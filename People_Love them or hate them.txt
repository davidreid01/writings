People_Love them or hate them

An interesting point about Bertrand Russell is his love for mankind yet his acknowledgement of all sorts of stupidity and selfishness
that individual men engage in.

Love of mankind:
Quote what he truly loves.

Idiocy of some men:
Quote Versailles agreement.
Gold mining and subsequent reburying.

Selfishness of some:
Quote middle size child hitting a small child.
