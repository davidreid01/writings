Jim Jefferies on Larry King.

Jim Jefferies talking on Larry King was more considered than his speech on Bill Maher's Real Time where he clashed
with Piers Morgan. Piers Morgan is obnoxious and it was good that he was taken down.
He was still saying things that are a bit wrong.
  Gun control.
  The Port Arthur massacre was the largest mass killing by only one person in Australia not the world.
  That there was not another mass killing in Australia is not due to gun control laws.
    The gun used was already illegal.
    Murder remains illegal.
    You cannot make something more illegal.
  But the gun buyback helped ...
    Maybe afterwards but it would not have helped in the Port Arthur massacre.
    The then Prime Minister John Howard explained his reasoning for the buyback.
    "If someone goes berserk with a knife or a hammer a lot less people will get killed than if they have an assault rifle."
    The intent of the buy back was to reduce the number of guns in the community and by extension reduce the damage of future massacres.
  Why gun control does not work.
    Bad people are going to get the guns whether they are illegal or not.
