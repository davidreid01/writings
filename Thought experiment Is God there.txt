Thought experiment: Is God there?

To determine whether believing for God is right for you.

Method:
1) Think the question "God are you there?".
Closing your eyes might help but really it is unnecessary.
2) In your thinking listen for a reply.

Results:
	If you get no response:
		God either:
		1) Cannot reveal Himself to you.
		2) Chooses not to reveal Himself to you.
		The definition of an existing all powerful God precludes the first option.
		God who knows everything will know that you thought the question.
		God who can do anything will be able to answer.
		2) is where this gets unpleasant.
		"For God so loved the world He didn't bother to let the world know." John 3:16 (altered)
 
	If you get some response:
		Question.
		What was the response?
		Was the response related to the question?
		Do not be afraid to repeat the test to remove other distractions or variables
			because you know God gets tired and loses his patience easily with his chosen ones.
			If God is not prepared to do the test again for you then you are not really His chosen one.

Arguments against the usefulness of this test.
1) God will not be tested by Man.
What you 'say' about God is being put to the test, not necessarily God.
We need to determine whether what you are saying is true.
"What is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence."
2) God doesn't have to answer now.
If God doesn't answer now then He doesn't get the benefits now.


What remains is not that God is being put to the test but what you say about God is being put to the test.
Human weaknesses are to be removed. Weaknesses such as lying or believing lies.
