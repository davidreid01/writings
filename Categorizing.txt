Categorizing

People categorize things this means they give things labels and deal with all things with that label similarly.
This makes thinking quick and easy but maybe wrong.
Two possible errors here:
1) You have put the thing in the wrong category.
2) Your treatment of the category is wrong.


Merging Arguments

Coming up with a conclusion based on two different arguments.
Ex.
Argument 1
Premise A
Premise B
Conclusion C
Argument 2
Premise D
Premise E
Conclusion F
Therfore
Premise A true.
Premise D true.
Premise E true.
Conlusion C and F.
No.
If argument 2 is valid conclusion F is sound.
If argument 1 is valid conclusion C is still undecided as one of its premises is undecided.
"But I've come so far, I've got A, D and E and I really think C is true."
No, conclusion C depends both on argument 1 being valid and premise B being true.
