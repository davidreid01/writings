Left vs Right Politics

Heard political approaches called leftist or rightist.
Confused?
You are meant to be.
One definition:
Left is "I am my brother's keeper".
Right is "everyone for themselves".

By this definition religious people especially Jews and Christians are leftist.
"Love your neighbour".
But politically evangelical christians are seen as rightist.
Why?
Evangelical christians are insulted by the left.
"These fools believe things without any evidence."
That may be and believing things without evidence is stupid but insulting people is a sure way to not merely drive them
away but drive them into supporting the insulters opponents.
They then become easy to manipulate by rightists who can simply win their support by not insulting them.
