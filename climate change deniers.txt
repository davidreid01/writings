climate change deniers

Why do climate change deniers argue successfully?
Part of the problem is listeners rely on expert opinion.
"There is a consensus of climate change scientists that climate change is occuring because of man's activity."
There is the problem, listening to authority.
Because authority is being used it can be denied.
"What consensus?"
	- I have never heard of any compromise that I was not a part of where I profitted.
"What climate change scientists?"
	- You mean those who agree with your consensus?
"I have not read any scientific papers on the subject."
	- I am not interested in reading any scientific papers and probably have never read one in my life.

The basic problem is people buying pre-packaged thinking.
When that is done a cost-benefit analysis over-rides determination of what is true.
I can choose to believe either climate change is being caused by man's activities or not.
My motive is not whether it is true but whether it means more money for me.
