can, cannot, will, will not

Some cannot because they will not.
	"Not going to. Ever."
Some cannot regardless of whether they will.
	"I'd like to be Miss Universe but I am ugly."
Some can but don't because they will not.
	"Got talent but no interest."

"Advise" is debatable.
What value is "advise" if you don't think for yourself?
There is difference between telling what another should/ought/must do and letting them think
through the issue for themselves.
For the advisor who doesn't want to assert authority.
Don't speak imperatively, don't issue decrees or commands.

Correct a wise man and he will be yet wiser.
Correct a mocker and you will receive abuse.
