Now

The only time you have to do anything is the NOW.
The past is gone, never to return.
The future yet to be, tomorrow never comes.
Now is the only time you have to change.

Do you want to achieve something?
NOW is the time to start.
NOW is the time to continue.
NOW is the time to put in the last piece and finish it.

If not NOW, WHEN?


Later means not NOW but an undefined time in the future.
How does anybody (especially you) know that it has made it on a TO DO list much less has confidence that it will ever be done?

If is followed by a conditional but when is also followed by a conditional.
A conditional specific to time.
I'm going to do it when Hell freezes over.
