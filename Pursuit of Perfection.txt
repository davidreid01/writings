Pursuit of Perfection

What is 'Perfection'?
	Perfection is a state from which you cannot improve.
Surely, that is not it else being dead would count as being perfect.
Imagine an offender sentenced to death. Would they be made perfect by being executed?
	No, when people think of perfection they think of something that is really good
	and something better can not be imagined.
	I hope you can see the many problems here.
		1) What people think is variable.
		2) What people describe as being good is variable.
		3) Whether something is 'better' is a matter of opinion.
		4) It can never be attained.
		5) How do you know if you have reached perfection or the just the limit of your imagination?

	Conclusion:
	'Perfection' is vague.
	It is better not to pursue something 'Perfection'.
If not 'Perfection' why 'better'?
	1) The variable definitions of 'good' are not required.
	2) What is 'better' is a matter of continuing discussion.
	3) It is not a state, ever, where you cannot improve.
	4) 'Better' is a process not a destination, it can be done.
