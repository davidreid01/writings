Easy or Hard.

This thought is about the assymetry of cost-benefit.

There are jobs that are easy to do but pay greatly and jobs that are hard to do and pay poorly.
Firstly the cost side:
Is a job or task easy or hard?
To answer this question consider how long it would take you to do it successfully.
Some jobs require definate training and knowledge that you would have to acquire.
Example: Brain surgery - medical degree (6-8 years full time) + several years working + further specialist training.
One can see that to be a qualified brain surgeon requires years of study.
Someone who has not had the training simply would have to add this time before they could do any such job effectively.

So someone who has not already had the training the job would be hard.
For someone already skilled such a job might be easy.

Second there is the benefit or reward side:
Some caveats regarding rewards and benefits:
1) Are only really given if the job is completed successfully see elsewhere on cheating.
2) Are only given by contract. That is by offer and acceptance.
Do a job where no one agrees to pay and what you get is no one will pay you. There are other benefits of work.
3) Time is an important aspect.
If I have to wait for you to train so you can do the job then that time will be considered.


Getting back to the assymetry point.
You want jobs that are not difficult or easy for you to do, this reduces your cost.
You want jobs that others consider hard this increases your reward.
Do a hard job that others consider easy then it better be good practice as it will get you little else.
Continue to be assigned hard jobs that others consider easy and if you are not learning enough that the jobs become easy then
you are being treated as a fool, doing the work but not getting the reward.
