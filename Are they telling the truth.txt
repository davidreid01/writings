Are they telling you the truth?

If a person thinks you are a fool and is not constrained in specific ways by conscience, morality, ethics or a code of honor.
They are going to tell you things that they believe will more likely put you in a frame of mind to do things that put money in their pocket
or increase their power or increase their social status by showing you a fool to others.
What they tell you will have no relation to reality.
Any truthfulness is irrelevant.
Not accidental, not unintentional just simply irrelevant.
The goal is to win the argument.
One way to not tell either lies or truth is to ask questions.
Asking questions is a good thing, finding accurate answers is even better.
But asking questions is often used as a tool to cast confusion not to point out sloppy thinking.
The purpose of some questions is not to find the truth but to make the other person look silly.
Again it is the game of social rank being more important to the asker.
What to do about this?

One thing that annoys me is questions that ask 'What do you think?'
It is not polite social form to answer a question with a question except in the case of qualifying components of the original question but
this bad question deserves a bad response.
'What do you care about what I think?'
It is put out there as a lure to fools to opinionate and too often they fall for it.

Have you heard people say 'I think ...'
This is not an effective argument.
Firstly, I don't care what you think.
Secondly it is lazy. You are putting the burden on me to find out why.
	I have to dig thru your opinions to find out why and maybe I can't be bothered.
Even worse is 'I don't think ...'
	It has all the problems of the previous issue with the added bonus that there is an infinity of things you don't think.
