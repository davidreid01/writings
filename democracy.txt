democracy

Speculation ->
The reason for democracy is to replace leaders without the need to have them killed.

Leaders sometimes try to take 'society' in a direction others do not want it to go.
Sometimes an issue becomes pressing to 'society' that a leader does not think is significant.
There becomes a recognizable movement (an active effort) to have the leader replaced.
Power is addictive and people do not want to lose it.
Staying in power and having the power to choose your successor was what resulted in the ancient dynasties.
This has not changed.
If a leader needs to be replaced and will not go by their own choice then one way to remove them is to kill them.
In ancient days this was the only known means.
It also meant killing the leaders supporters so no successor could arise.
Indeed, whether or not they wanted to go by their own choice, killing them was the only way to be sure.

Killing competant people is inefficient and retards society.
Great effort put into making the leader and getting others to submit to this leader.
This effort is lost when you kill the person.
Furthermore there will be great loss when the leader tries to stop this from happening, they will believe
	this is the way things are done.

Efficiency of democracy.
This loss is avoided by potential leaders know that they are only there short term and that they will not be killed
	when they leave.

Dictatorships.
Are the modern equivalent of the ancient method.

Communist Republics and Pseudo-democracy.
Use the name of democracy but are really dictatorships.
There is no instance of an ideal socialistic or communistic society, all have been taken over by fraudsters.

Corporate Power.
