Public Debates

Are about your position on the Social Hierarchy.
Win and you may go up.
Lose and you'll look like a fool and probably go down.
If others look like a fool then relatively you'll look better.
If someone ahead of you is made to look bad they may end up behind you.

This needs to be stressed: public debates are not about searching for or discovering the truth.
It is naive to think they are.
If you do think this way then those who don't have an advantage on you.
You are not playing the game.
Others who are will beat you.
This will only lead to frustration and loss.
