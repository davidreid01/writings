Stupid selfishness

Some people act in a selfish way.
They do not consider others.

Two facts which these people ignore:
- their actions are being observed by those affected and others who will hold it against them.
- that not helping your neighbour will mean that your neighbour does not have the resources to help you.

What we often see is a minor, trivial or negligible gain combined with a major loss.
As the loss is to occur in the future it will be ignored as it doesn't yet exist.

Stupid selfish people seek alibi not success.
If we win I will collect.
If we lose I must have someone to blame.
The focus here is on the collect/blame not the win/lose, this is not a team player.

Origins of stupid selfishness.
This is speculation not established.
Selfishnesses origin is in past injury.
The person has developed the notion that they must do everything themselves, they must care for themselves (as no one else will).
They only see the team members
