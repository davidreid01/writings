Your Better than Average and other cheap praise.

'Your Better than Average' and its variants are the cheapest of praise.
Why?
It is true of most people most of the time.
How is that possible certainly half the people have to be in the lower half?
Yes and No.
What is questionable is what is being compared and by whom they are usually different things.
Examples:
A gym attendant to a potential customer.
Gym Attendant says: You are interested in improving yourself most people are not.
Note: The average person does not enter a 'gym' so without doing anything else you have declared yourself to be above average in respect to
interest in fitness.
Note 2: The average person in your city has never entered this particular store.
Note 3: Of all the people (~7 Billion at the time) in the world the average person has not even been to your city.

Further examples:
Consider wealth.
How much money do you have in your bank account (your total assets)?
The average person has little (get statistics on what the average person owns).

Consider skill.
If you have practiced a musical instrument for over a month then you are better than most who just pick up the idea of learning an instrument.
Above average.
If you have done any programming at all then your above average, most have never done it.
