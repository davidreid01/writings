Trump's Mistakes.

Does not learn.

Does not admit error.

Speaks as if saying something means it becomes true.

Has surrounded himself with 'Yes men', who dependant on Trump for their income is going to tell him he is wrong?

Has succeeded because he has had money on his side.
Trump never realized his opinions and say so do not make reality.
He has blinded himself to criticism.

He is acting like the school yard bully.
Something is true because I say it is.
If it wasn't so, I wouldn't be successful.
Success -> Truth.

WRONG.
