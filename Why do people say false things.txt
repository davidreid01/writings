Why do people say false things

If a person says something false they either:
1) have not studied, are misled or have not looked for evidence.

2) want you to believe something that may be false.

3) want others to believe that you are declaring something false.

In the case of 1) they may be ignorant.
	Build up the understanding from first principles.
	In doing so they will come to their own understanding.
	It may expose errors in your own thinking and you can correct.
In the case of 2 and 3 they are being obnoxious.
	First declare that you don't believe what they just suggested.
		'I don't know about that'
		'I am not sure'
		'Where do you get that notion?'
