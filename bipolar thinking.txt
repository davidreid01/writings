Bipolar thinking

Why do people discuss politics in terms of left and right?
	Everbody has their own interest, the number of sides is not 2 but the number of people involved.
	Is it possible to be for public health care and against other government hand outs?
Have you ever been asked your opinion and the answer is expected in terms of like or dislike?
	There seems no "I don't care" or "meh" option.

The reason for this is two fold:
1) You can either do a thing or not do that thing, there is no sort of do that thing.
2) Flags are used to rally people. You are for a tribe or against it.
	You support a view point or you don't.
These are similar but not the same. The first is what you do. The second is what is offered for you to do by someone else.

Because much public debate mentions only the two options and neglects many of the other options
there is a tendency to think that the people involved in the debate are inferior in intelligence.
This encourages post modernists to see this and think that 'binary opposites' are the way people think.
Because of their 'understanding' it is easy for them to view other people as stupid.
It is encouraging for people to believe that they have an understanding that others do not.
