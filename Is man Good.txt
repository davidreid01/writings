Is man Good?

The socialists - man is intrinsically good, any fault in man is due to the systems that he is under.
  If we get the perfect system we will get the perfect man.
  I am unsure if any of the high level socialists actually believe this.an
  Certainly, this is the message of the socialists.

The Christians - all of man is corrupt and needs God's help.
  Some regard this as 'man is evil' and this leads many anti-christians and the socialists to assert 'man is good'.
  This is an infantile approach and St Paul's description does not help.
  St Paul's Description - You were evil (many bad things) before you met me and know that you have believed what I told you,
  you are now good. (get ref)
  A better description is man is corrupt but worthwhile.
  How is man worthwhile?
  John 3:16 For God so loved the world he sent his only son.
  What about the Jews and the Noah story?
    Another question for another time.
What about us? What do we know?
1) Man makes mistakes.
  Man is not perfect.
2) Man is self conscious - no other life form is known to be.
3) Man has achieved things.
  No other known life form has a space program.
From an evolutionary perspective Man has developed beyond all other known life forms and has acquired
aspects and capabilities like none other.
From this (that evolution has spent a lot developing Man) we gain the idea that Man is 'worthwhile'.
Worthwhile but not perfect.
This is the basic idea of Judeo-Christian insight before it was corrupted by the authoritarians who simply want power over
others and drive others into self abasement.
