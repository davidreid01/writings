Where it went wrong for me

Looking back at my life I can see things could have gone better if I had of done things differently.
But I didn't and didn't know better at the time.
There are two aspects:
1) not knowing because you couldn't know.
2) willful ignorance where you know you don't know and know how to find out but yneou don't try.
there is really a continuity here where these aspects are extremes.
such as knowing you don't know and not knowing you can find out or knowing you don't know and believing you will not be able to find out.
The end result is the same action or lack of it based not on knowledge but on guess or hope.
If you are 'lucky' your action is in accord with reality and there will be good consequences.
If you are 'unlucky' your action is not in accord with reality and there will be bad consequences.

Things that I needed:
1) To be able to sort out who was an ally and who was not.
  Not being able to do this was a serious problem.
  I trusted people and things they said when I should not of.
  My parents are examples of this:
    My father was never my ally and he didn't even pretend he was.
      I really should have seen this.
    My mother was not my ally. She just used me and kept me infantile.
      I needed to do things for myself but she did them for me.
      At the time I did not realise and just thought 'OK' but remembering what happened it kept me weak.
  So why did I trust them when I shouldn't have?
    Firstly, children have no real choice but to trust their parents.
    Secondly, religion encourages belief without evidence.
      If you are good to them they will be good to you.
      No.
      This is naive, wishful thinking.
      If bad people see you do this they will take advantage.
