How to tell false praise.
What is praise?
	Same as or similar to compliments.
	Praise is recognition that you are worthy (of something) by having achieved something.
	Praise allows you to feel that you are worthwhile.
	People of low self esteem have a need to feel worthwhile, children have a need for external validation.
	Both of these types of people are easily manipulated by praise.
	Praise has a psychological effect.

Empty Praise.
	Praise that does not reference an achievement or accomplishment.
	Eg. "You are great" "You are intelligent" "You are beautiful"
	That the one being praised has not done anything to earn the praise.
	Empty praise should not give you any psychological boost at all.
	If it does then you have a problem with self esteem.

We need to ask:
	1) whether the praise is itself false.
		*) Praise can be false as it does not apply to the one being praised at all or usually not.
		A proper answer to this praise is "I don't think so".
		*) Praise can be true relative to the praiser. Eg. "You are beautiful".
		*) Praise can be true/false relative to the praisee in comparison to others.
	2) what the motive of the praiser is.	

	3) what the praiser is trying to achieve.
