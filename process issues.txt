process issues

'Process Issues' is according to Patrick Bet-David the number one lesson to teach your children and the number one
thing to do in life. (References needed).

What simply does this mean?
What are its implications?
What are the consequences for getting and doing this against not?

Meaning 'Process Issues':
You need to learn to:
1) Realize what the issue is.
2) Work out what needs to be done in order to get a desired result.
	If I want A then I need X and Y and Z.
3) Plan every step in the right sequence that needs to be done.
4) Do.
5) Review.
	Did you get the result you hoped for?
	If so you processed the issue.
	If not what went wrong?
		Try again.

Implications:
This needs to be appied to all areas of life.
	If there is something going wrong then was there an issue you didn't process?
Do not think you can do anything simply by wishing it.
	The answer to the what went wrong question will end up being you didn't do step X.
Nested Issues.
	There are issues within issues.

Consequences of not processing the issue against doing it.
1) Problems are not solved and will remain.
	You will be living with an unsolved problem.
	Mostly in life others will not help you.
	Very rarely will and usually only incidentally will another solve one of your problems.
2) You will become vulnerable to people who only want your money.
	If you want a problem solved and are not prepared to properly research it then
		you can gamble your money on someone else fixing it.

3) Your ability, confidence and/or will to solve problems will be diminshed.
