My mother complained about the minister Neil how he effectively pushed former minister Steven Hooper out.
There was too many ministers and not enough money to go around.
She blamed it on the way young people were behaving.
I disagree that the cause is 'young people' rather that people are being led to believe that there are winners
and losers. There are advantages of being a winner and punishments for being a loser.
If someone is going to be retrenched the operators of the system are going to sack the least productive member.
It is more a case of you are in my way, reward that I could be collecting is going to you.

It is not 'loving' to allow a person to become incompetant.
It is not 'loving' to push them out of a position that provides what they need.
In short Neil is not behaving as one would expect of a christian.

There are many notices of the church lacking money received through donations.
Could this inconsistency explain why people are so tepid in their support.
