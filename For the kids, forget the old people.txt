For the kids, forget the old people.

Have you ever wondered why there is a specific age where people are treated completely different for the same thing?
Uncoordinated behaviour
- children - sympathy, "poor kid."
- elderly - sympathy, "they have troubles"
- everyone else - contempt, "degenerate, glad I am not like that."

For a lot of things 18 years old is the number.

(Maybe two issues here)
definitely at least two issues here
1) Personal profit
2) Position in society

Cynical approach:
Some want to profit by others continuing to do silly things but don't want to be seen as harming the future generations or
be seen as one who takes advantage of silly people.

Eg. 1) Legal to sell cigarettes to adults, not legal to sell to children.
Eg. 2) Gambling is legal for adults, not legal for children.

Argument:
Adults should know better, kids are vulnerable.

Reposte:
Adults are also vulnerable.
Kids might find out better.

Why for the kids:
The younger someone is the easier they can be retrained.
They have potential and likely will be around for a while and remember how you have treated them.

Why forget the old people:
Adults are not you (obviously) or likely not your kids.
Their potential is gone and they will not likely be around long to remember how you have treated them.
Older people have had bad experiences and are not as likely to trust.

Why sacrifice your wealth to benefit others? What return is there for this?

Why forgetting the old people is a bad idea:
Kids may see no hope and suicide or worse murder-suicide.

Yet still "It's not my problem" and "I need to make my way in this world".
There is the contempt of "They chose to believe false things", this leads to indifference of the suffering of those
who did believe in false things and tolerance for those who profitted by telling lies.
