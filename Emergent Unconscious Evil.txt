Emergent Unconscious Evil

Emergent - It came with self consciousness, animals do not have it.
Unconscious - People are not aware that they are doing it.
Evil - It is bad behaviour with bad consequences driven by bad motives.

Why unconscious evil? Surely there is conscious evil.
Yes there is but there is evil being done by people who don't realize it.
I am not saying conscious evil is less destructive or not significant but the destruction
caused by well intentioned people who do not think that they are can be mitigated by wisdom,
by people becoming aware of who they are and what they are doing.
People who do evil deliberately need to be dealt with differently.
Furthermore I wish to make obvious the falsehood of man being intrinsically good.

Many people are simply not aware the consequences of their actions are bad.
Man caused climate change was not commonly known.
Yes it was known by some scientists, speculated by some intellectuals but unknown by the masses.
