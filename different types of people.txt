different types of people

Dunedin study (Ref needed)
Took many people born in a certain year and recorded each of their life progress.
The people fell into several main categories, they are:
1) Achievers. about 10%
2) Well Rounded. about 40%
3) Reserved. about 25%
4) Anti-social. about 15%
5) Withdrawn. about 10%

The categories had these conditions
1) Achievers - Very successful. Had all of purpose, persistence and worked well with others.
2) Well rounded - Marginal success but OK. They work well with others but lack a major definate purpose.
3) Reserved - Marginal success but OK. They have a major definate purpose but do not work well with others.
	Persistent but try to do everything alone.
Which leaves the last two groups who do not succeed in life.
4) Anti-social - trouble makers, often picked up by the police.
5) Withdrawn - hide from life.
Both these last two groups do not work well with others.
Anti-social and unsocial.
The anti-social may have a major definate purpose but if so it will be prevented by people resisting their
	attempts at domination or maybe they will find it more amusing to manipulate people than accomplish anything.
Withdrawn people will not have a major definate purpose. If they have a benevolent purpose it is more of a dream and
	they do not have the persistence to get anything done.
