good and evil

Problem of evil.

1) God is all good.
2) God is all knowing.
3) God is all powerful.
4) Evil exists in the world.
So ...
either
if God does not know about the evil:
    Therfore God is not all knowing.
else:
# God does know:
    either God can do stop/prevent the evil or he can't.
    if God can prevent the evil:
        He did't/doesn't so does not care.
        Therefore God is not all good.
    else:
    # God can't prevent the evil.
        Therefore God is not all powerful.
So ...
if evil exists:
    God is not (all powerful and all knowing and all good).
To say another way ...
if evil exists:
    # one of the following must be true
    God is not all good or
    God is not all knowing or
    God is not all powerful.
Which was the definition of God to begin with.
Therfore contradiction.
Therfore there is no one who is all powerful, all good and all knowing.


Problems with this argument:
1) The definition of 'Good' and 'Evil'.
What is 'Good'? What is 'Evil'?
Is the definition of good and evil the same to everybody (absolute) or can every one make up a definition (relative)?
If relative then what is good for God is different from what is good for you.
This means that this argument reduces to 'The God I would want to believe in does not exist'.
If you say that the definition of good and evil is absolute, applying to everyone regardless of their beliefs
then you need answer whose belief is the right one.
So...this argument has either little meaning if 'good' is relative or requires you to explain God if not.
Which was the point of the argument anyway.

2) God may also to having his own definition of 'good' may also have a plan to deal with 'evil'.
Unfortunately the defintion of 'good' and the plan may not be to your liking.
You may be 'evil' and destined to be eliminated.
