You need this.

The first thing you need is to be able to spot what is good for you and what is not.

a) Human relationships have a strong effect on people.
A good person can help you and push you forward.
A bad person not just can but will pull you down.
This is not symmetrical it is easier to cripple someone rather than heal them.
To not merely 'go forward' in life but to prevent becoming trapped or wasting away, get the offending bad person
out of your life as soon as possible. They will stymy you and prevent you from growing.
A person may be good to others but not you, that doesn't matter, if they are bad for you get rid of them.
So how do we identify people who are bad for us?

b) The Easy Way.
Having things easy means you will not grow.
You have heard the phrase 'no pain, no gain'.
This does not mean that pain will give you gain.
That is a logical error.
No pain -> No gain
is logically equivalent to
gain -> pain
the pain -> gain is false logic pedalled to many religious people
who think they can earn their way into 'heaven'.
