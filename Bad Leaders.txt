Bad Leaders

If a potential leader laughs at someone's stupidity then
when they are promoted to team leader, put the person they laughed at on their team.
Reason:
1) They have to deal with lesser thans.
2) They have to realize they are going to get the consequences of all their actions.
	Everybody also gets the consequences of everybody elses actions but leaders have to realize it better than most.
3) By taking amusement over someone else they are showing that they value their social rank ahead of the success of the business.
Unless they have done something special to earn the privilege to choose their own team do not give it to them.
To do otherwise is to show weakness.
It is a privilege to be able to choose your own team.
By giving it to them shows everyone else that you are pandering to anothers will, the act of either desperate or neglectful or indifferent person.
This will erode confidence and respect in you.
