The problem of the social hierarchy

Societies work more effectively than individuals.
No individual can assemble a jet air liner but groups of individuals can.
A social hierarchy is where those above can have more and better everything than those below them.
People can be promoted or demoted on the social hierarchy.
When we admire someone we give our approval that they should be promoted.
When someone disgusts us we give our approval that they should be demoted or removed from society altogether.
Some admirable traits are intelligence, beauty, courage, conscientiousness, industriousness.
Some dishonorable traits are deceit, cowardice, laziness, stupidity, ugliness.
It is acceptable when someone is promoted for doing the things we admire.
It is acceptable when someone is demoted for doing the things that are dishonorable.
It is a cause for outrage when someone is promoted for doing the things that are dishonorable.
It is a cause for outrage when someone is demoted for doing the things that are admirable.
NOTE:
1) you cannot either give approval or be outraged by something you do not know about.
2) you will know your position on the social hierarchy and whether someone is above you or not.
  You can then ask why is this person where they are?
  Many people do not ask why someone is lower, they already have a reason.
      'I am better than them.'
      'They are lazy.'
So what is the problem?
There are many cases of people having been promoted thru bad means.
This causes far more outrage than when people are demoted for good things.
