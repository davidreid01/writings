Tai Lopez

67 Steps
What it is?
	67 Videos + 1 introduction of Tai speaking of what he knows of becoming successful.
	Each video has a series of questions that unlock the next video.
	You are meant to watch one video per day.
	New videos are not released until the time is counted down.
	I think the timer is based on time of purchase and not when you answered the questions.
	Once the answers to the questions are submitted and the timer is reached then the next video is available.
	Answers can be anything they are looked at by others.
What does it cost?
	$70USD. It should be a once off payment it is not - see VIP program.
Is it worth it?
	If you are already successful or have great life wisdom then probably not.
	If the choice is to watch this or spend time and money on wasteful things then it is definitely worth it.
Who should buy it?
	Anybody who:
	1) is not successful
	2) if you are not business savvy or don't consider yourself business savvy.
	3) is young - older people will constantly think why wasn't I told this? There are reasons you weren't.

Who should buy it?
	I don't know.
	I didn't do one of the twice monthly calls, I just saw the money flowing from my account and put a stop to it.
