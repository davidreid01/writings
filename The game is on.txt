The game is on.

The analogy that life is a game is commonly held.
How life is like a game:
1) There are rules.
	Science is the process of discovering the rules.
2) There are winners and losers.
3) It has a beginning and an end.
	You are born, you will die.

How life is not like an usual game:
1) You do not begin the game with any prior knowledge.
	This includes but is not limited to:
		a) that it is a like a game.
		b) any knowledge of the rules.
2) You cannot easily look up the rules.
3) You define what it is to win and lose.
4) You are a player.
	Not a by-stander.
	Not a spectator.
	It is not a representation of you, it is you.
5) You can choose to do nothing but you cannot choose not to play.
