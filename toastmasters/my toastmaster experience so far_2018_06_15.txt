I have now had my 3rd meeting as a member.
I had 3 meetings as a non member.
I have attended 2 meetings of Speechcraft as a helper.
It is helpful to see improvement and to be able to compare bad vs good.
To be able to see someone do what is wrong and to see someone do what is right.

There are two people I would like to discuss.
Michael Bumba and James Eadie.
Both of these men did not show up to the second Speechcraft meeting.
Why?
Michael Bumba: I have only seen once at Speechcraft. I spoke to him once and his contempt for me
was obvious. After speaking less than half a minute mentioning self improvement, he silently stared
at my gut. It was like 'your words say self improvement is good but your fat gut says something else'.
He spoke well in his first lesson of Speechcraft.
James Eadie: I have seen him once at Toastmasters and at the first meeting of Speechcraft.
I spoke to him once at Toastmasters, where Brian Havilah praised him for having talent.
Thinking back over the conversation I consider he also held my in contempt.
Did they both give up because of me? Is that just a paranoid thought?
I spoke also to Kosta Brusov at both Speechcraft meetings and he didn't quit.
A likely possibility is that my contemptibleness pushed their thinking into considering Speechcraft not worth their time.
'If I have this ability, why do I need to put effort into this?'
