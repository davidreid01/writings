Things to learn

Some things that you need to learn:
Check that you have covered them and make some notes if you think you can improve.
The time to learn them is now.
It matters not how old you are the past is gone never to return.
The future is unknown and not yet here.
The only time you can act is the now.

1) Think for yourself.
Do your own thinking.
If you push or sub contract this out you will become a slave and you won't know it.
It is well known fact that cults spend effort to control what one of their followers thinks.
It is a bit lesser known that propagandist organisations also spend effort to control thinking.
	Some groups are:
		All religions.
		Anti-religion.
		Communism.
	One way you can tell is if someone says lets have a view of X from Y perspective.
It is far less known that advertising does this and they are far more subtle than cults.
	The reason for the subtlety is they aim at a much larger and more diverse audience and only seek a minor influence.
	It does not matter if a specific individual is controlled.
	What is important is that there is a net influence on the whole population.

2) It is your life.
What happens to your life effects you.
	Others will be effected by what you do but this is secondary.
You achieved something or didn't.

3) Work out who is good for you.
A person who is good for you will push you to be a better person.
There is little worse than having bad influences.
'Bad company breeds bad habits' so the clich√© says.
Most people will not want to think that they are bad people and nobody will say they are a bad person.
A person maybe though good to most people is bad to you.
You need to recognize this and if they are bad for you then you need to cut them out of your life.
Not doing so means they will pull you down or undermine you and mostly this is subtle and not consciously known.
