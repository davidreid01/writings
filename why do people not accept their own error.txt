why do people not accept their own error?

Their position/stance/way of living is tied to their self esteem and self view.
Any pointing out that they are wrong is an attack to them, even if what is pointing out the error is their own perception.
It has to be fought.
Denial is the last resort if evidence is overwhelming.

What is needed to fix errors?
1) An error needs to be acknowledged.
This acknowledgement does not have to be made public.
2) An error needs to be investigated.
Is it an error?
What are the consequences of not fixing?
3) A plan to fix the error.
Doing things without thinking them through is a way of unnecessarily creating more errors.
4) Fix the error.
5) Check. This step is not required but should be done.
Has the error been fixed?
Have new errors been created?

Improvements vs. Errors.
