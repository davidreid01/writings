links and refs.

Links to other web documents can be or become bad in several ways.

Change of Reference
1) Change in location of the resource.
If the resource has moved or been deleted the link is completely ineffective.
2) Change of the reference.
The author of the refernce may have edited the reference in such a way that it no longer supports the argument.

Incorrect reference.
1) Reference does not support the argument at all.
2) Lazy reference - reference does not take reader to the right point and would force them to read the article from the beginning
to check the reference. Most would not bother, giving the reference a TLDR; Too Long Didn't Read.

What to do?
Firstly, if a resource does not support the argument don't use it, even if a particular line or passage seems to support you.
Lazy References
- if you have not studied the entire article to see that it does support your argument a lazy reference is unhelpful.
- it is up to the author to put in the offset to get to the correct point.
Major revisions need to check that the references are still good.
Minor revisions will be commented on.
