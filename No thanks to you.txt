No thanks to you

Looking at the mistakes I made and other mistakes that were made by other people.
Name a time when a person admitted error and fixed it.
To show an error publicly is to shame the person who made it.
To show an error privately is still to shame the person who made it,
their ego in front of you takes a beating.
They can't be superior to you if you point out a mistake they made.
