Are you going to fail or you headed for disaster?
A quick check list.
This is to test if you are likely to fail.
My hope is to allow you to see potential problems and fix them up before you receive the consequences.
This is will not prevent you from failing.
Remember, this is life there are no guarantees.

1) Do you do your own thinking?

2) Do you have a major definate purpose?
Yes - Really?
	Have you written it down?
	Can you speak it in one or two sentences?
	Do others who know you well when they think of you they think of your major definate purpose?
	This last one is tougher to answer.
	If any no then you do not have a major definate purpose.
3) Are you making daily progress on your major definate purpose?
