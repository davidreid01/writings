Improving your social standing by wrecking others

To fail is bad, to be seen to fail is far worse.
To admit you made a mistake is to leave yourself vulnerable to attack from bad people.
Most can admit mistakes to those they consider friends but refuse to admit mistakes to others.

If you make a mistake and others see it then do they point it out to you privately, point it out publicly or say nothing?
If they point it out publicly they are trying to rise socially over you.
  'See this person made a mistake, what they are doing is lame'
If they point it out to you privately, then it can fix it without social stigma.
If they say nothing either they missed it, ignored it, see no benefit in speaking or are saving it up to hit you later.
These last two are certainly not mutually exclusive.
