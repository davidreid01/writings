Bertrand Russell

Held that the human race is worthwhile and at the same time much of humanity was committing idiocy.

Evidence for Worthwhile.
Quote - later thoughts - "Three simple things have shaped my life - longing for love, search for knowledge and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind"
The fact that he wrote and argued things that are against political correctness and exposed the foolishness of the then present practices
which would have been denied by those who profitted by that activity.
The truth mattered to him.

Evidence for idiocy:
Quote - "Many would rather die than think, in fact they do so."
Quote - "I saw a middle sized boy beating up a smaller boy. I expostulated.
	He replied 'the bigs hit me, I hit the babies that's fair'.
	In that he summarised the history of the human race."
