Forgiveness

Definition:	need refs.
To end someone elses debt to you without seeking payment.
To restore a broken relationship.
To reach peace after hostility.

To forgive is divine as in some people believe it does not exist.

To repay your debts to someone who thinks you are a moron is a waste, it does not heal the broken relationship.

What if you have a debt to someone and you think that they think you are a moron.
You might be wrong. You might be right.
What is the basis for your thought that they think you are a moron?
They might be waiting for some sign from you.
They might think that forgiveness and conscience is a weakness and if you offer anything they will take it but not forgive you.

So who moves first?
