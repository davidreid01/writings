why listen to someone with no authority?

Is not listening only to people with authority an instance of survivor bias?
Do not people without authority have lessons to be learnt?

If you listen only to people who have been 'approved' of by society aren't you cutting yourself off from different opinions?

Do you do your own thinking?
Carl Sagan's Baloney Test says "... in science there are at most experts, no authorities. Authorities have been wrong
before and will be wrong again." (get ref).
