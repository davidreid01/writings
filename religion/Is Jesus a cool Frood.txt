Is Jesus a cool Frood?

Definition: Frood.
	A hip, together guy.

How do we know what Jesus is like?
How do we know what Jesus proposed?
What are his ideas?
Where do we get knowledge of his ideas?

The only place I know of that we can get some notion independent of any personal revelation is the bible.
The bible was written by scarcely known authors who were either not eye witnesses (St Paul is not an eye witness
despite his encounter on the road to Damascus) or wrote much later than the events.
Even though the veracity of the bible is questioned let us judge Jesus by what it says.

Jesus teaching on:

Preparing for the future -

"Do not worry for tomorrow, tomorrow will look after itself"
In other words what is done today does not matter.
This is counter balanced by the parable of the talents where God is the investor, the diligent is rewarded and the slothful punished.
In other words it does matter what you do today.
This is a case of saying things both ways.
This means either:
	Jesus is confused.
	Jesus is opinionating at the time and doesn't really know but wants to keep authority.
	Jesus is telling one thing to one group of people and one to another.
