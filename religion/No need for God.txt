No need for God

God does not help me this means either God does not exist or God does not care about me.
Where is the evidence for God?
Lives of believers (Why the Protestant work ethic is bad):
Some think they are earning God points.
They do this by 'acts of service'.
'Acts of Service' include church attendance, assisting ministries or missions, donations and charity.
If God does not exist or care for you these activities only return value for what they give the recipient or what is seen by others.
Giving anonymously returns no benefit to you.
