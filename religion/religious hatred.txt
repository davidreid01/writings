Religious Hatred

'Good people do good things, bad people do bad things. For a good person to do a bad thing takes religion.'
Steven Weinberg (get exact quote).

The question is why do religious people act in self righteousness and inflict injury?
This question is more important for Christians as Jesus promoted on numerous occasions the idea that you should not return
evil for evil.
Let us take a look at St Paul.
'As for righteousness, persecuting the church.'
He believed, before his conversion to Christianity, whole heartedly that Christianity was wrong and that it was
a needed thing to crush it and any who practiced it.
Why?
It is 'us and them' mentality.
You are either for us or against us.
You either support the mob or are the target of the mob.
There is a false dichotomy here.
I don't support what the mob wants and I don't want to be the target of the mob.
