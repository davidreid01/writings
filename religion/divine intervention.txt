divine intervention

Does God intervene in the affairs of man?
How can I know God when I only have men's stories of God?

When different men say different things about God why doesn't God make it plain what the truth is?

God will not be tested by man.
What does this mean for trying to find out about God?
God cannot be discovered by science.
There will be no repeatable test that can establish God.
A historical event occurred but is not repeatable.
Or to repeat it would involve unrolling the universe and rerunning it, nobody can do that and how would it be observed?
