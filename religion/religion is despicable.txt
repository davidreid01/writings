religion is despicable

Why?
It encourages people to pretend.

People are encouraged to believe that God (a magical super force) loves them not just others but them.
Believing this, people will think that God will save them from any trouble and warn them of any possible mistake.
What happens when God doesn't save or warn them?
Many believers suffer badness and make serious mistakes.
What does the bible actually say?
John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son."
Note this, God loves the world, not you.

From OT. Saving the remnant.
Time of Elijah.
"There is a group of Israelites who have never bowed to Baal."
This group gets saved, everyone else does not.
Conclusion: God saves only those he wants to.
Is there any evidence that God would save you?
What good is going to come of people pretending God will help you?

"Jacob I loved Esau I hated" demonstrates God choosing.
What if you are like Esau and God hates you?
What evidence do you have that you are like Jacob?
Wouldn't God allow you to think that you are like Jacob and give you false evidence that promotes this belief if He really hated you?

Jesus: "I go to prepare a place for you, in my Father's house there are many rooms ... "
Is this referring to the afterlife or something else?
Is Jesus talking to you or someone else?
Is he speaking true or just saying things for effect?
If he hates you may be he is stoking the fires of hell.
