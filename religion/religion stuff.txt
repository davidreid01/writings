religion stuff

Why are people of one region or culture of a similar religion?
Why are Arabs predominantly Muslim where people from Italy are predominantly Roman Catholic?

Answer:
Meh!
The statement that your religion is determined by the region or culture you grew up in is partly true,
partly false and entirely misleading.
Growing up in a region or culture does not force you to be of a particular religion.
So why is there a predominance of one religion over others in a region or culture?
Speculation:
Peer pressure.
The need to be a part of the local society.
Imagine a young Jew who does not want to go to their Bar Mitzvah(coming of age ceremony, get proper spelling).
To not pick on Jews you can also imagine a Catholic or Anglican not going to Confirmation.
Such a person would be shunned by the society.
What would people do?
Most would keep their beliefs or opinions to themselves, simply pretend and go along with it.
There is great motivation to not go against the society.
Therefore a society will have at most one religion.
Many societies live in a region.
A culture may contain many societies.
Being a member of the local group is important not the region or culture.
Societies may change direction, remain as they are or die out.
