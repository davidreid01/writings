Religion Vs God

Ever realised religious people talk of God, non religious people talk of religion?

Why is simple.
Non religious people do not want to acknowledge something they have no evidence for, God.
	So they speak of religion which is an activity of Man.
Religious people believe they have a relationship with God and the activities of Man is irrelevant in comparison.
	So they speak of God.

So what is wrong with this?
There is little room for communication.
Non religious people do not want to speak of God and religious people do not want to speak of Man's activity without God.

How do we reconcile this?
Difficult - since both parties don't want to move.
The only time they do talk as the other is when they are trying to convert the other but at that time they do not listen
	to the other's arguments, point of view or anything.

Is reconciliation or reasonable discussion impossible?
No. Don't give up. Difficult does not mean impossible.
