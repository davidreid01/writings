Find out if God is there

Pray or simply think this question:
"God are you there?"
If you hear nothing to let you know God is there, if you feel nothing to let you know God is there ...
then God has not revealed Himself to you.
He has not let you know.
Why?
Three possibilities come to mind.
1) God did not hear you.
	If God is as wise as is made out then He can hear your question.
2) God was not capable of answering you.
	If God created you He would know how to let you know even if you don't.
3) God did not care to answer you.
At least one of those must be true for now.
At this moment God has not answered you.
God is busy, you have been put on hold.	
You are not important enough to talk to.
Don't you feel God's love?
This does NOT disprove God, this only proves that if God does exist then He does not care for you.
