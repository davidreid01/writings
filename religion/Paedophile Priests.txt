Pedophile Priests

How can a person preach the 'love of God' and then molest children?

1) Pure fraud.
  There are those who do not believe in religion at all but both see a profit in it and are
  willing to lie.
  Why does the church do not do more to find these people?
    They don't care, those who see the church as a swindle that they want to control and profit by
    are only concerned about the churches reputation.
    These people are offended by the exposure of the evil not of the evil itself.
    Unfortunately for the true believers this is what we see.
    Senior clerics are more concerned with the churches reputation than with stopping evil.
    It is more likely that an offending priest will be moved and protected than be exposed.
  If the churches reputation matters more to the higher ups then why don't they leave the priest to hang?
    Several reasons.
    The main reason is that it will point to their guilt in being an accomplice to the behaviour.


2) Divided mind.
  Their are those who believe in religion and yet consciously commit evil.
  How can they do this? Surely their conscious would tell them of this inconsistency?
  They can if they divide their mind like a Dr Jekyll, Mr Hide.
  The good part of them does not recognize the bad part of them and blocks out any evidence of the bad part that
  is not consistent.
