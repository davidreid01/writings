religious speculations

1) None have ever answered adequately the question
'How do you know?'

2) People who are making a claim, how do not have a good answer do not ever ask this question.

3) 

Why I believe religion is pernicious and why people who promote it are bad.
Why is religion pernicious?
1) It encourages people to believe without evidence.
	God has revealed himself to you.
2) It encourages people to say they believe even when they don't.



People who promote Religion are either gullible or bad or both.
