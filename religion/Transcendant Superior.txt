Transcendant Superior

There is a need in people to believe something that is greater than them otherwise a person may succumb to megalomania.
By transcendant I mean beyond, external to you
Examples of people who succumbed:
  - several Roman emperors who proclaimed themselves 'gods' and required divine worship from
  their subjects (many ancient rulers did this).
  - Napoleon, Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong, the whole of the 'Kim' dynasty of North Korea.
  - Trump and Putin want to join this crowd.
Religious people make this God.
There is no need to make up stuff about a deity.
The human race, life or the bigness of the universe itself is sufficient.
