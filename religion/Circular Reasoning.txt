Circular Reasoning

Q - Why is does God exist?
A - Because the Bible says so.

Q - Why is the Bible true?
A - Because it is the Word of God.

This is circular because the answer of one part is the question of the other AND
the question of one part is the answer of the other.

We can never get to a result without accepting as an axiom one of the question answer pairs.

Can we express this in the language of logic?
A - God is true.
B - The Bible is true.

A because B
B because A

What tricks are used in circular reasoning:
1) Obfuscation and confusion.
	It is easy to see the fallacy when things are expressed simply.
	By complicating you can confuse the person who is intellectually lazy.
	What if you make it:
		A1 because B1
		B2 because A2
	yet A1 means A2 but in different words, same with B1 and B2.

2) Enlarge the circle:
	A because B because C because D
	D because C because B because A
	The aim here is to target the intellectually lazy.
	The circular reasoner will then argue
		A because D
		B because A
		Therefore not circular.
	But it is.
	The logic contains
		A because B
		B because A
You can see a combination of confusion and enlarging the circle means most people will give up and accept it.
People who want to win the argument socially not logically
