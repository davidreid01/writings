False Dichotomy

What is False Dichotomy?
When one thing is said to be the opposite of another when it is not.

Ever hear if one thing is not true then it must be the other thing.
Logically this is if A is false ~A must be true.
The problem is not the logic but the asscription of what A is.
Logically the statement really becomes A is false therefore ~B, this is not a conclusion it is another
statement that may be either true or false.
But they use the word 'therefore' so it is a conclusion, right?
No, the use of 'therefore' is misleading.
The argument is invalid because the so called conclusion does not follow or it lacks a conclusion at all.

ASIDE:
One trick false argumenters use is 'many statements no conclusion'.
The idea is that the numerous statements will wear you out so you will accept what they want.

What is the problem with false dichotomy?
It is bad thinking.
It will lead to false ideas.
The false ideas will lead to bad actions.
The bad actions will have bad consequences.

Can you give some examples of false dichotomy?
