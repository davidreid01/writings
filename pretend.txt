pretend

The 'Poison' of religion is pretend.
Religion encourages people to pretend.
How?
	'God has revealed Himself to you.'
Do not promote this belief and you have nothing that others will want to listen to.
Promote it and others will be interested.
If God has not revealed Himself to you then you are making it up and pretending.

Pretend and Biblical Christianity.
'O Ye of little faith. With faith as small as a mustard seed you could move mountains.'
What is this faith Jesus is talking about?
Many would interpret this as 'if I believe enough the mountain will move'
St Paul later says 'faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we cannot see.'
-> Get exact ref.
-> make sure that it is not just what St Paul hopes for.
This seems bad advice, so saying in other ways.
If you hope enough that the mountain will move it will.
I don't accept that many would accept that interpretation.
Get other interpretations.
How do they interpret these passages?
If not a literal interpretation then what and how did they arrive at their interpretation?
