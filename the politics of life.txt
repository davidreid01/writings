the politics of life

There is competition in every aspect of life.
To believe otherwise is just denial or pretend.

It does not matter if:
	*) you are on the same team.
	*) the person is your friend or ally.
	*) the person is in your family.
		"Money is thicker than blood"
	*) you are paid lowly.
(these are common excuses for not recognizing competition)

In what ways have you failed to recognize competition?
