Looking for the Truth

You tell me what you think.
I listen.
I consider what you have said.
I correct my own view.
I speak to you of what I think.
You listen.
You consider what I have said.
You correct your view.
You tell me what you think.

The cycle goes on and on.
We both get a better understanding of how things are.

But if one person thinks they are superior then this cycle is broken.
The person who thinks they are superior does not tell the other what they think rather they tell the other
things to control them.
The person who has contempt for the other will not listen.

So how do you tell if a person does not want this truth seeking self correcting feedback?
They don't tell you what they think.
They keep their own view secret and unfalsifiable.
You cannot judge them, they give you nothing.
Judging others is not the aim, finding out and fixing your own errors is.
