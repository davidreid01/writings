The levels of suicide

Personal Suicide.
	Killing yourself.
	For those who have no offspring this is also family suicide.

Family Suicide.
	Killing those who share your DNA.
	Ending your contribution to the genetic pool.

Tribal Suicide.
	Killing all of your tribe or social group.
	Has anyone done this?
	Maybe they have.
	I am thinking of great betrayals or the example of the fall of Byzantium.
	Did someone leave the gate open thru incompetence or were there people sick of the rulers and wanted change
		or was it a bit of both?
	Survivors of the losers blame incompetence, a traitor, not having hindsight anything but themselves.
	"If only we did this." "If the situation were different." 
	The leaders of the winners will take credit for themselves.

Great Suicide.
	Killing all of life or all of your species.
	This has never been done or you would not be reading this.
	Has anybody fully wanted to do this?
	It would mean there would be no one to remember, no one to mourn over what might have been, ever.
	It would be all over.
