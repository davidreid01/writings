Conditions for Entry:

Must Have:
* Be able to sign contracts, eg over 18 and not an invalid.
* Basic English speaking, at least primary school graduation level.
* Basic English reading and writing ability, at least primary school graduation level.
* Not a fugitive from justice.
* Citizenship: see below for further details.
* A desire and capability to put in effort.
* Good natured: see below for further details.
* Truth seeking: see below for details.

Preferred to have:
* 

Citizenship:
Australian - always OK.
Any permanent resident is OK.	
NZ citizenship is considered the same as Australian citizenship for this.
Citizenship must be OK at time of application and before acceptance.

Good natured:
Most think they are good.
Those who are not good will not admit to it.
Therefore we need an objective definition of good.

Definition of Good:
The human race is more important than the self.
This definition seems a little vague.


This entails:
* Not blaming others for your lot in life.
* Helping others even when they don't deserve it or will not return value.
* Do not think about or carry out revenge or any form of bad payback.

This is listed as a must have and for the application and acceptance it is sufficient to say it is so
but it will be tested and is a cause for dismissal.

Truth seeking:
There are several parts:
1) Do I seek the truth?
2) Do I encourage others to seek the truth?
3) Do I profit/gain from others believing false things?
