Where did I go wrong?

My biggest mistake was trusting people who I should not have trusted.
They did not push me to develop except in that they could further my usefulness to them.
Looking back, there were signs that could have been read by someone who was looking for an answer to the question "should I trust them?".
Not looking for evidence to answer a question I wasn't even asking, it is not surprising I missed all the clues.
Significant relationships and hints I missed (or simply ignored).
My mother:
  The biggest hint was the way she would do things for others.
  What she did: the job, for you.
  Never showing you how to do the job.
