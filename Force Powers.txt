Force Powers

Test yourself.
Try to pick up a small object with your mind alone.
Nothing else touching it, like another person or a robot.

Fail?
Why?
It is not working today.
Can you recall an example of it ever working?

Try again.
Did it work?
No.
Will it work later?
What makes you sure?
What makes you think that it will ever work?
