The Three stages of Suicide

1) Consideration
Where one thinks about committing it.
Why does one consider it?
Life is painful, pain is the biological mechanism that says 'don't do that' or 'something is wrong and needs to be fixed'.
People most of the time reject suicide as an option as the solution to problems will only be found by facing them and thinking thru them.
Some will point out that problems will not be solved by suicide, it avoids them but this is largely irrelevant
as the suicider has given up caring.
If a person believes that a problem cannot or will not be fixed and life is seen as too hard to deal with then the person may
decide on suicide.

2) Planning
Once a person has thought that self termination is the better path.


3) Execution.
This may seem like a bad pun but suicide itself is bad.
Despite what it may seem to some people, often the step between planning suicide and carrying it out is sometimes large.
This depends on the persons courage, stubbornness, persistence.
What were noble traits, in this case have become bad.
