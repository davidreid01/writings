Believing false things

To believe false things is a mistake.
Why?
It leads you to do bad/dumb things you wouldn't if you did not believe the false things.
How do we know if something is true or false?
The simple answer (though not easy) is the scientific method.
Design a test that will answer whether it is true or false or maybe.
How will we know if the test finds the answer?
Do not we have to design a test for the test?
If we do then how do we know this test of the test is accurate?
Is this not an infinite loop of unsureness?
Certainty in anything cannot be attained.
Trying to gain certainty will paralyze you.
The clock is ticking dude.
What will you decide to do?

What remains is to have confidence that the answer you believe in is right.

Some answer that it is required to have faith to overcome this paralysis.
Faith in what?
What someone says?

Is the scientific method a guarantee of truth?
This question is misguided in many ways.
1) The concept of 'guarantee' is dubious.
	It is a promise made by a person.
2) Certainty cannot be attained but this does not mean that a high level of confidence can't be.
	Certainty may come with infinite testing, this however is not possible.
