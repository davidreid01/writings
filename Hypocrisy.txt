Hypocrisy

(Need formal definitions)
Defn: Saying you believe one thing yet your actions show you believe something else.

Is admitting you are not perfect and still make mistakes yet holding that there is a better way hypocrisy?
Example:
My 6th grade (final year of primary or elementary school, about 12 years old) teacher often warned us of the evils of smoking.
The question would quickly come "but Sir you still smoke, Why?".
He could easily be seen to be someone who regularly smokes.
Usually a packet of cigarettes could be seen in his top pocket.
Often when on play ground duty he would smoke.
He would answer "I know, I've still got rocks in my head."
In light of current understanding - he had a serious nicotine addiction.
In those days there were no nicotine patches, gums to help, to give up it had to be by abstinence, simply not doing it for long
enough to overcome the addiction and get into better habits.
Was he a hypocrite?
He warned people not to smoke and told of the consequences.
He still smoked.
