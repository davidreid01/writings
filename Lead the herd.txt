Lead the herd.

Every shepherd whether good or not eats roast lamb.
Society rewards those who gather the proceeds of the masses regardless of what the masses believe,
what they tell them and whether it is true or not.

This means bad people are encouraged, deceiving others is encouraged as long as your not caught.
Winning is the important thing.
Morality is irrelevant.
Religion is a good thing to mislead the other person.
Example: James Packer made a lot of money investing in Casinos, he is respected.
		Casinos make money by taking it off people being silly, this is encouraging bad thought.
		Gambling is cheating the fool, not an honorable source of income but James Packer is still respected.
