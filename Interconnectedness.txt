Interconnectedness.

Metaphor:

Exit of EU by Britain.
Would it make it harder for continental businesses to do business with Britain?
Tolkien: Lord of the Rings: Elf to Hobbits.
"This is not your shire, it was here before Hobbits were and will be here after Hobbits are gone.
You can shut yourself in but you cannot forever fence the world out."

Why Britain should not leave the EU.
Example:
1) Australian wire industry sought to protect Australian jobs by making Australian specific standards
to be adhered to.
Result: Foreign companies adapted and still out competed Australian companies, while charging more
to meet the extra criteria.
2) Independence from Australia.
	I will now examine two regions.
	i) Nuigini (Papua New Guinea) - became independent in 1975? forming there own government and legal
system. After much struggle and poverty
	ii) Norfolk Island 

Both were impoverished by isolation. Business unsure of getting return on investment left them.
Nuigini survived Norfolk Island did not.
Nuigini is a large territory with people used to fending for themselves.
Norfolk Island is populated mostly by European descendents and without trade went bankrupt.
Norfolk Island's local administration was taken over by an Australian appointed governor.
