prove it.

The fact that you say this is evidence that you are not seeking the truth of the matter.
If you were seeking the truth of the matter, you would either
	know a valid counter argument because you have investigated the matter.
		You might be wrong but you will never know unless you engage me in dialogue.
	OR
	would ask me my reason for saying it.
		To think through my reasoning will make your response faster and better.
		If you are wrong there is a chance that you will realize it.
		Again you will never know unless you engage me in dialogue.

The 'burden of proof' belongs to the one making the assertion not the listener.
The 'burden of proof' is not worth pursuing if the person you are talking to is not concerned with the truth.
The person is seeking to bring their mind or life into alignment with reality or they are trying to make you look foolish
and by doing that increase their social rank.
When someone's intent is not to seek the truth and they say 'prove it', just say 'no', whether or not the 'burden of proof' is yours.
Indeed when someone has this stance, cut them off, end the discussion as soon as possible.
This will require social skill if you are involved in a public or semi-public discussion.
