suicide prevention

You think suicide is bad?
Right?

You want to stop suicide?
Ask yourself, do you want to prevent people from committing suicide or remove the causes that lead to people wanting to commit suicide?
Is your desire to improve the human experience or more selfish?

Preventing suicide can involve methods that do nothing to alleviate the underlying problems that can push a person to want to commit
suicide in the first place.
These are:
1) Physically preventing the ability to commit suicide.
Examples:
  i) Gun control
  ii) Pharmaceutical control
  iii) Intervention. Jailing. Padded cell.
  iv) Force feeding

2) Mentally preventing the ability to commit suicide.
  i) Punishment in the after life.
  ii) Social retaliation for suicide.
    Grave plots for dishonored. There was a section for the burial of suicides in medi-eval churches.
