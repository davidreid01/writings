Encouraging delusion in others

It needs to be said that this practice is evil but it is often done.
Why does it need to be said?
	Many do not think about it.
	In not thinking about it many do not realize the bad consequences that flow from this.
Why is it evil?
	People do bad things based on bad thinking.
	Remember the Nazi holocaust, the terrorist attacks of September 11 and others.
	These were undoubtedly caused by people who believed false things.
It may be evil but it is not illegal.
	It is illegal to do something that harms another.
	It is not illegal to hold a belief that leads to doing harm.
	It is not illegal to persuade others into a belief that leads to doing harm.
Why do people promote false belief?
	Speculation:
		They do this to promote themselves over others in the social hierarchy.
	If others sabotage themselves by believing false things then they will be higher than them.
	This is the bad way of climbing social rank.
	It not merely drops them down, it also lowers the whole of society.
