Conspiracy Theories

Are problematic because they distract people from looking at the facts and considering what they mean.

1) It takes time to dismantle false arguments.
	Time is required from the knowledgeable, time they may think is wasteful.
	Time is required from people who need to think through the issues.
		These people will see time being spent not helping them.
		They will move on, the opportunity for them will be lost.
2) Facts need to be verified.
	Facts not verified will be disgarded as non-facts.
	A common tactic of conspiracy theorists is to lay on the facts thick and fast.
		Sometimes they do this so fast there is no time to verify them.
		This convinces no-one but it helps them maintain their delusion.

These leads into better ways to construct arguments.
Consider the other person.
Their time is important and even more important is their attention span and their desire to listen to you.
Ever heard of the businessman who is prepared to give you several minutes of their time and you better
make it worth their while or they will not listen to you again?
This is generous, most people will not give you 5 seconds of time when they are actively listening but will not want to tell you no.

1) Use the smallest number of facts.
	Do not waste time validating facts not relevant so don't even mention them.
2) Keep the argument tight, no unnecessary diversions.
	Images and analogies can be useful but they can be a diversion where they think about that and ignore your argument.
	When a person wants to think about your image rather than your argument, then it may be impossible to bring them back and
		you have lost them and the argument.
Note: jokes can be useful but are often distractions.
	If your intent is to make a subtle point that their mind will pick up later then OK, otherwise no.
