Delusion of competence

Dunning and Kruger did a study on the competence of people and came up with the result that:
A person needs the skill to determine whether they have the skill.
The bottom peformers claimed to have the most skill.
Why do people pretend to have something they don't?
	Self worth - you need to be able to say "I am good at this".
	Believe false compliments.
		To gain the good will of another, people use compliments.
		These compliments may or may not be true.
		A delusive person will accept as true something they want to believe is true.
		What is needed is to determine whether it is true.
		Also compliments might not be as things are but as they might be.
		A poorly given compliment will not make this clear.
		The delusive person will then choose what is meant.

Preventing Delusion.
	For others:
		Do not give false compliments.
		Do not hide conditionals.
			E.g. Hiding "You will be good"
			Not hiding: "You will be good if you practice and study"
		Make clear present state vs possible future.
	For self:
		Test statement to check whether it is true.

Causing delusion:
	Some intend to cause delusion, others test to see if person would delude themselves.
