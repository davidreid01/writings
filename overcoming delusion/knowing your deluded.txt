knowing your deluded

This is tricky.
If you are deluded:
1) you will not know that you are.
	You have allowed your brain to be deceived.
	You have chosen to believe something without evidence.
	Your ego is now in opposition to admitting you were wrong.
2) others can see that you are.
	It will be obvious to others that you are basing part of your life on something false.

Can others help you?
Yes, but they usually don't.
Why?
Ask what is their advantage to help you?
1) If you are a rival or in some sort of competition with them then they will not want to help you.
	If you disable yourself they are more likely to get the prize or win the sale.
2) If you are the sucker.
	To be seen helping a sucker may put them at risk of being treated as the sucker.
	They have some feeling of superiority over you that they may not have if you overcome your delusion.
	Some enjoy watching others be stupid, shadenfreude.
3) You have not asked for their help.
	You will not ask for help because you don't know you need help.
	To help someone unsolicited sometimes invites abuse.
