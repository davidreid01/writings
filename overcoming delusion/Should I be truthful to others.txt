Should I be truthful to others?

Don't consider 'deserve', 'justify', 'responsibility'
Consider 'Consequence'.
What is going to be the result?
Ask yourself several questions:
Does this person have power over me, if so what?
What could/will happen to them if they don't change?

Giving the truth tactfully.
The aim is for them to come to a greater understanding.
This will only happen if they think through things for themselves.
1) Do not give commands.
	This will trigger fight or flight response, which does not allow deep thinking.
	The immediate response will be 'who are you to order me'.
	This will take both their thinking and the conversation in a direction different from the aim.

WHy do I do this?
Give a command saying not to give commands, rewrite.
