Why do people choose to remain deluded?

There are definite benefits of making decisions on accurate information and definite penalties for making them on false assumptions.
So why do people choose ignorance rather than finding out.

1) Intellectual laziness.
It takes effort to find things out.
Remain deluded and you don't need to bother.
2) Pride.
You need to be able to admit that you could be wrong.
This seems to oppose some peoples ego and sense of self worth.
3) Position in Social Hierarchy.
There is reward for getting things right and punishment for getting things wrong.
It is better to be higher up the social ladder than lower.
If you are seen as getting things right you will be promoted.
Seen as getting things wrong you will be demoted.
Why admit you made a mistake that could get you demoted?
If you can convince enough people that your idea was OK then you will not be demoted.
There are examples of people who rise in the social hierarchy yet who promoted ideas that were later seen as bad.
