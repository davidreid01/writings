What is wrong?

People think only of what they can gain.

People are often mistaken.

Libertarian arguments say why things don't work.
But they do not say why a "free market" does work in practice.

The "Free Market" presupposes a number of things:
1) People can wisely spend their own money.
How it stops the market being free.
If people don't spend their money wisely then society will build vanity projects of the wealthy while others starve.

If that were so there would be no advertising in excess of informing people of available services.
There is so this statement is false.
What of a modified statement:
"People can wisely spend their own money better than someone else."
This modified statement is more often true than false.
It is a good argument against command economy approaches and government hand outs but it becomes useless when money
is needed to fund public projects that private enterprise can't or won't. Eg. schooling for poorer people, NASA.

2) People can always negotiate effectively and can walk away from any bad deal.
How it stops the market being free.

This is absurd idealism.
