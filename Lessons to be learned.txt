Lessons to be learned.

Note: Patrick Bet-David's idea of the number one thing to be learned is 'Process Issues', from which all else is derivable.
This may be true. The main point is that you think about it or you will not derive anything.

1) Think for yourself.
Don't do this and you will be a slave.
Worse, you will not even be able to see yourself as being a slave, despite the fact that you are.

2) Your life, your responsibility.

3) Everything has consequences.

4) Set your own goals.
Your goals need to be yours.
Not your parents.
Not your friends.
Not your societies.
Not this is a way to make money.
Your goals are what your life is aiming at achieving.


5) What you do now matters.

6) Explore.

7) Listen.
