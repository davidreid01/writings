differences in arguments
Note: by argument I mean subject under discussion not a logical argument.

disputes in arguments arise from
1) difference in conclusion of the argument.
2) difference of the truth or falsehood of the premises of the argument.
3) non acceptance of the validity of the argument.
4) difference of the relevance of the argument.
"I think we should be discussing something else"
5) difference of 

Methods of controlling the conversation.
1) Changing the topic.
Discussing one thing, leave it unanswered and introduce a new topic.
Problem:
It seems like job done so time to move on.
Human nature would like to think job done with or without having put any effort in.
The job is not done.
This departure causes problems.
1) It breaks the rhythm of the conversation.
2)Returning the conversation to finish off the job causes irritation.

The irritation will be blamed on the returner not the departer.

2) Baiting for a straw-man counter.
Re-interpreting the argument to be something different.
If argument was X->A change it to Y->A or X->B then demolish that argument.
Dealing with it.
Don't take the bait.
1) Know your argument.
2) Correct any misconception immediately you recognize it.
3) Start saying 'No', 'You've got it wrong'
Problems:
It will make you look a fool if you fall for it.
It will break the rhythm of your speech.
If you don't fall for it, correcting them then they will look foolish.

3) False contradictions.
Disagreements that are not logical contradictions.
Eg. "You say frogs are green, not true crows are black".
The truth or falsehood of either statement is not revealed.
