Prayer what it does.

Prayer works in several types of people, in several ways.
Prayer allows:
1) good, well intentioned people to do nothing.
2) evil people to pretend to be good.

Some points by advocates of prayer.
1) Prayer brings the problem to a persons attention, they are thinking of the issues.


Some points by opponents of prayer.
1) The prayerer effectively denies that they have any role in finding or working the solution to the problem.
	Acknowledging that there is a problem but not searching for what the problem is, how to fix it or making known any desire to do so.

It is important to note prayer comes in two forms.
1) Praise - "God is good" - this requires no response from God and is not the subject for the rest of this article.
2) Request - "I see this is a problem." - this is direct request for help to deal with the problem.
	This does require a response.

What do advocates of prayer typically regard as answers.
1) Yes.
2) No.
3) Wait.
How do advocates of prayer typically regard prayer as have being answered.
1) The issue has already been or being dealt with. Thanks for your concern but further action on your part is not required.
2) The issue has yet to be understood by the people involved, please wait.

From opponents of prayer.
1) All answers lead to a do nothing stance for the petitioners.
2) Why do people attribute things to God when they are in their favour and to the corrupted world when they are not?
