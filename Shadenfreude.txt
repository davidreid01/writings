Shadenfreude
German for 'damage joy'.
Taking amusement from others misfortunes.
This single word in German has no single word equivalent in English.
Why?
There seems to be a hole in our language, Dear Liza, Dear Liza.
There's a hole in our language, Dear Liza, Dear Liza.
(This is a play on the childs song "There's a hole in my bucket.")
That this German word has no single word equivalent in English when it is quite common means
that we are hiding, pretending that we don't engage in it.
Like Americans masturbate while Australians wank.
Make it difficult to describe something that is not approved of.
This is stupid.
It does not work.
We need a single word, preferably a single syllable for something that is common.

Why do people take delight in others misfortunes?
Neuro-scientists what is the mechanism involved here?
