Capital Punishment
AKA the death penalty

Why is it bad?
1) People make mistakes.
	No-one is perfect.
	
2) People have bad motives.
	Selfishness is always a part of us.
	With some the selfishness is so deep that the benefit of anyone else including the environment (except as it effects me) is irrelevant.
	You might want to disagree here or simply say "not me" but think again.
	Babies, all babies are completely selfish.
	This is not the same as 'evil' or worthless simply they have not developed the ability to not be selfish.
	Some never gain the empathy or the understanding that they are part of the universe and their well being depends on others.

These lead to the possibility of acknowledging your errors and repenting of your bad thinking.
In the case of the death penalty:
	1) there is no possibility of restoration.
		They are dead.
		You might wish to believe in the resurrection of the dead but there is no evidence that you (or any other human) can do it.
	2) there is no possibility of admitting error to the victim.
		They are dead.
		Sure, you can apologize to their family.
			Fat lot of good that will do.
