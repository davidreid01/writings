philosophy

Philosophers do not answer questions but ask you to think thru them.

Immanuel Kant
Think for yourself.
Do your own thinking.

Enlightenment is the escape from self incurred immaturity.
Immaturity is the inability to reason without guidance from another.
This immaturity is self incurred when it comes not from mental deficiency but from cowardice.
