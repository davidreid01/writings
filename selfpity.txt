Self Pity perspectives
from others
	This person is rubbish.

from self
	Woe is me.

One particularly bad aspect of self pity is that the pitier cannot see their predicament and the viewer refuses to tell them.
So they will remain stuck, not improving.

What to do?
The solution is that the self pitier needs to see themselves as others see them.
Give them the truth.
If they respond with abuse then this is their behaviour and loss.
Who is going to help them again?

There is a need to separate issues of ego from the issue of the truth.
Some never give the truth as they want a victory over them.
Many never give the truth as they want to avoid a possible conflict.
