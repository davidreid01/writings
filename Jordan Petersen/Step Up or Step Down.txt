Step Up or Step Down

If you have a good experience then that will make you happier and stronger and more attractive,
which will increase your chance of having another good experience.
You should be able to see that you can get on the beneficial positive feedback where life gets better and better.
The opposite is also true.
If you have a bad experience, the chance of you having another bad experience increases.
You can circle down in depression, alcoholism, poverty and finally insignificant death.

I remember a 'downer' who left his car parked in a small commercial retail carpark overnight.
Note: This was not illegal. The parking was free and unconditional yet as we shall see it wasn't wise.
A group of bad people rolled his car over.
Presumably for malevolent fun.
