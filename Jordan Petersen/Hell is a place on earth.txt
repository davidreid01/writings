Where is my life going?

JP - 'Hell is a real place'
JP - 'If you haven't met anyone in hell then you have not lived'

Set yourself a 'heaven' to move to and imagine a 'hell' where your life will be in 3 - 5 years if you do not sort yourself out.
Something to move toward and something to run away from.
Then you will be motivated.
