Why Jordan Petersen is wrong?

Jordan Petersen's asserts that getting rid of religion will knock out the foundations of human psychology and the whole of the enlightenment thinking.
He complains about atheism that:
There is nothing to stop a person from choosing to be irrational or self seeking without regard to others all the time.
	This is a little ingenuous, he describes evolutionary biologically how the brutal chimp hierarchy is not a stable
hierarchy and will be overthrown by a benevolent chimp leader who cares for the other chimps.
This is a reason to choose to be benevolent.
