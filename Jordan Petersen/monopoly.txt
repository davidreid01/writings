Monopoly

When playing monopoly one realizes the game ends up with one player having all the money and everyone else having zero.
On each turn around the board you will gain or lose.
The more you have the greater the chance you will eventually win.
The less you have the greater the chance you will eventually lose.
As the game progresses the players will get more ahead or more behind whenever you reach zero you are out.

How does this apply to life?
The more you have the greater the chance you will eventually win.
The less you have the greater the chance you will eventually lose.
Reaching zero does not just mean zero money but other things like relationships, skills, potential also count.
Reaching zero will mean you are out of society and will soon be out of life.
