Cain and Abel

Curious is Dr Petersens explanation of this tale.
Absent from the original tale is why Abel was better than Cain, why Abel's
sacrifice was pleasing to God and Cain's wasn't.
It is interesting this absence entitles Dr Petersen to put his own ideas over the top of this and explain
why Abel is better than Cain.
Compare with Bertrand Russel's interpretation:
  Pure or puerile propaganda -
  Abel was a pastoralist, Cain was a farmer.
  The Jews were pastoralists, the Egyptians were farmers.
  Therefore the Jews are good, the Egyptians bad.
Why is this interpretation wrong?
Why was Abel being better than Cain not a part of the tale?
If they didn't know and they only spoke (before writing) of what happened and the necessary lead up as to why
Abel was good, Cain bad then why do people add in ideas from themselves which are not part of the original story
that fits with their world view?
They are not entitled to do this.
From what we know of the original story we cannot tell which (if any) interpretation is correct.
