How religion developed.
This is a complicated topic.

Polytheism over no religion.
How do things work?
You do not know.
Advantage over previous:
	You can buy a god off who has power over the thing you fear.

Monotheism over polytheism.
One God in charge of everything.
Advantage over polytheism:
	There is only one god to buy off.
	All your neighbours are allied to that god.

Eternal Monotheism over temporal monotheism.
This is the introduction of the after life
Advantage over early monotheism:
	soldiers do not fear death.

Each step advances the capability of the society.
The religion of a region is determined by the choice of the ruling class
and the ruling class will choose their preference which is usually the best.

Stalwart religions
Survived only because the local rulers chose them.
Hinduism - polytheistic
Buddhism - philosophic

Apparent exceptions:
Egyptian experiment with monotheism and reversion to polytheism.
Ahkhenaten forced monotheism on the Egyptians and took away the power of the priests.
When Ahkhenaten died the priests came back.

Spirits and ancestor worship
