Why Religion is bad.

It encourages belief without evidence.
It encourages belief despite evidence.
It encourages pretending something is true.

Compare the teaching of Jesus:
	"With faith it is possible to move mountains." (Get precise reference)
	"Without faith it is impossible to move mountains." (A different statement)
With St Paul:
	"Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see."  (Get Ref).

So if I believe a mountain will move it will.
If I believe a mountain to move and it doesn't, do I lack faith?
Can I build my faith by just believing harder?
Will believing harder make the mountain more likely to move or can the universe just say no to whatever I believe?

The wider statement of Jesus, the first one is contentious it says you can move mountains by faith but doesn't say what this faith requires.
The narrower statement of Jesus does not say much at all, if you don't believe then you will not achieve.

Pretending something is true when you have no evidence for it at all is dangerous.
If what you are pretending is true you will get away with it.
If what you are pretending is false and you are lucky you will get away with it (for a time and others may not be lucky).
If what you are pretending is false and you are not lucky you will get clobbered (and maybe those near you).
The lesson is simple:
	Do not pretend, find out.
	Change and fix if wrong.

It is also bad to keep pretending in spite of evidence.
Gone is any excuse that you did not know.
If you find out that you are wrong then change and fix.
There are two things that are bad:
1) Not bothering to find out the truth.
2) Not changing when you find out that you are wrong.
Both involve pretending that something is true when it is not.
