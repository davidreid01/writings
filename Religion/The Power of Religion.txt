The Power of Religion

Is Peer Pressure.
There is a desire to fit in socially amongst people.
This desire is evolutionarily developed.
If a society had too many individuals that lacked the desire to fit in then it could not compete with a society that did.
From an individuals perspective not living in a society increased the likelihood that you'd die without offspring.
The desire to fit in means there is a motive to not challenge the existing paradigm or regime.
This means that a ruler can not merely maintain their position but can get away with doing reprehensible things.
