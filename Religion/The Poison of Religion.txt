The Poison of Religion.

What is poisonous about religion?
PRETEND.
Religion encourages you to pretend that things are true when you have no evidence for them.
"You have believed because you have seen, blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe" - (Ref)
How is someone blessed by believing in things not seen?

Example: I have not seen next weeks lottery numbers but how can I be blessed by believing?

"With faith you can move mountains." (Ref).
What does this mean?
Does it mean if I pretend hard enough that it will become 'faith' and move the mountain?


Have you ever wondered why those who claim to be 'christian' knowingly carry out activities that are sinful?
The people fall into two groups here:
1) Those who do not believe in the religion at all but say they do.
2) Those who do believe but are pretending the activity is OK or the activity is not being done by them.
	In either case, they are OK.
	If you are going to make stuff up it must be internally consistent.
	In the case of activity not being done by them, them they blame people on not obeying 'proper christianity'.
	What is 'proper christianity'?
	They are merciful and forgiving when it comes to their own sins after all no one is perfect but they judge and
	call for repentence when it comes to other's sins.


Do you know why the religious are not good at comedy?
Comedy relies on the mismatch between what an idea leads to and reality.
