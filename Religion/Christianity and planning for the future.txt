Christianity and planning for the future.

Gospel of Matthew:
Jesus says "Do not worry about tomorrow ..."
Book of James:
James says "some say 'I'll do this' or 'I'll go there' but the success of any plan depends on God.
	You should say 'I'll do this if God wants it'"

So there is no point in planning, saving for the future or building a career.
Only if you take it literally.
If you don't take it literally you are using some interpretation to explain it.
Where does this interpretation come from?
Our understanding, that is why people disagree over the meaning.

But how can you go from "Do not worry about tomorrow" to "Do not consider the future"?
The pedantic hair splitting way declares tomorrow is different from the future.

Does the bible say to do something that is not good?
Are many self declared christians simply not living in accord with this?
	That is they declare "Do not worry about tomorrow" is true while they save money and build their career.
