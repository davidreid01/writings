One for the masses another for the elite.

Do you get the sense that some promote one message for some people and a different one for others?
Yes they do and this is not necessarily a bad thing.
An example of a good discrimination:
	Telling a child do not cross the road without your parent.
	Not telling an adult the same thing.

But not all discriminations are good.
An example of a bad discrimination:
	Telling people you don't like to invest in an opportunity you believe will go bad and
telling your friends to avoid the investment.

So what about religion?
Let us look at the teachings of Jesus Christ as written in the bible.

Teaching 1: Do not worry about the future.
(for the masses)
	Do not prepare for the future.

Teaching 2: Parable of the talents.
(for the inner circle)
	God is investing in you.
	Have something to return.

Are these teachings inconsistent?
Yes.
	In order to have somethuing to return you must prepare for the future.

How are these incompatible teachings resolved?
Jesus is saying one thing to one group of people and a different thing to another group.

Doesn't this allow religious people to 'cherry pick' what they want and discard the rest?
Yes.
