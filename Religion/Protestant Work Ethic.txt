Protestant Work Ethic

The 'Protestant Work Ethic' is responsible for American prosperity according to some historians (get refs).

What is the Protestant Work Ethic?
(Research this)
'Work hard and God will both reward you and look after you.'
The christian source of this is the idea that God has been and will be good to you and that in consequence (out of gratitude) you live a life of service.
One can see that if others believe this then they will do work while you don't have to pay them adequately.
They believe they will be rewarded in the future by someone else while you can get what they have now.



The Protestant Work Ethic vs christianity.
The Protestant Work Ethic can fit inside or alongside christianity barely.
It requires a christian to be very focussed as it is very easy to slip into self righteousness.
'I work hard he doesn't, I am better than him.'
Because the ease of which it slips into self righteousness it is not a good thing for the masses.
