Why do people go to church?

There are fears which every person has.
1) Fear of death.
	The dissolution and decay of the body.
	Entropy slowly wears down the physical mechanism (your body) till eventually it is no longer viable and stops.
	What happens to you, your consciousness, your existence after death?
	There is no evidence for anything spiritual.
	No evidence for any survival of consciousness.
	What do we know of death?
		It has happened to everyone we know of over 150 years old.
		The decay of the body happens to everyone.
		Once dead, nothing further can be achieved.
		The memory of you survives but that to fades and only great achievements will be remembered.
			Example: many remember Alexander the Great conquering the world, only through writings not living memory.
				but who remembers the countless others living at the time.
			(Not good example as others are remembered such as Philip of Macedon).
	How do we deal with death?
		
2) The fear of the unknown.
	Uncertainty.
	It is clear we know very little when we are born and are continually learning until we die.
	So we never and can never know all there is to know.
	There is something always around the corner, over the hill
