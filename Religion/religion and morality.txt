religion and morality.

Some people argue that religion is a source of morality.
They ask would you prefer to live next to Ned Flanders or the chapterhouse of Hell's Angels?
This is superficial thinking.
Firstly, your preference does not matter.
	What matters is what the people do.
What the people do depends on what they think.
There are three types of people who promote religion.
	1) Deliberate frauds.
	These people do not believe in God are only afraid that other people will catch them in their lies and seek revenge.
	There is no morality in these people and God seems not to point out their crimes to others.
	2) Fundamentalists.
	These people believe totally, often literally if the religion has a holy book.
	The morality of these people can be seen in their actions and be read from their doctrines.
	Some religions may be peaceful Buddhism and Jainism.
	Others like Islam encourage murder of homosexuals and apostates are not.
	3) Moderates.
	Comprise the vast majority of religious people.
	Usually flick from apparently 100% belief to 0% belief depending who they are with.
	They want to be seen as loyal members to other members of the religion but to others usually don't.
	To others they are often silent, not pushing their religion.

There is another step that needs to be addressed and that is what is the effect of other people having a belief but not me.


I was moral before, during and after I was a Christian.

Many people who claim to be Christian are not moral.
