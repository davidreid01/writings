The Three Questions

The first two are straight forward.
The third puts the nail in religion.

The questions are:
1) Do people tell lies?
A young child should be able to answer 'YES' to this.
There are many examples of people saying false things.

2) Can you deceive yourself?
A more uncomfortable question.
If you answer 'NO' how do you know that?
If you are self deceived you will not know that you are self deceived.
Tempted to put yourself in a good light by saying 'NO'.
If you have ever believed anything false you deceived yourself.
This includes:
Santa Clause,
a politician promising things they do not do,
a person who betrays you,
a person who says one thing and then does another,

It does no good to argue 'I believed things when I was young and foolish but I know better now'
because you do not know if your current knowledge is completely true and your knowledge will never be complete.
You might still be believing something false and not know it.

My Answer:
In looking at my life.
I can see times when I believed (I trusted and made a basis of my life) things that were false.
Without a doubt, I can say that I can deceived myself.

Finally:
3) How do you know?
What is the basis for belief?
