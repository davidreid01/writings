Why is Christianity bad?

Christianity is a religion.
It encourages you to believe in things without any evidence.
It encourages you that God loves you and that the future is in his control.

Belief in things without evidence.
'With faith you can move mountains' Jesus (ref needed).
'Faith is being certain of what we hope for and sure of what we do not see' St. Paul (ref needed).

Testimony as evidence.
Testimony is not evidence.
It is just another person's statement nothing more.
They may or may not be telling the truth.
What they say may or may not be correct.
