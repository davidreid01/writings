swearing on the bible

On what basis is this done?
An honest person will tell the truth anyway.
A dishonest person will lie if they see it in their own interest to do so.
It is not effective for many people.

Is it a religious thing?
Jesus rants against it using a God based argument but it is clear that he does not accept that using God's name
is an effective way to determine truth.

It is not a christian thing so why is it done in traditional christian societies?
There are lots of people hedging their bets on the God issue.
These people often believe that it is OK to lie on small things but not on big issues and
definately not if they get caught.
These people are being reminded that they are being watched and what they say to a public court is important.
If they are found to be speaking falsely to the court they will be punished.

Other religions:
For the most part other religions are minorities.
Minorities do not assert themselves and if they do often become the subject of abuse.
The survivors of such abuse will keep quiet.
The main exception to this is Islam, where if they are in the minority are prepared to fight.
The accomodation made is to allow such people to swear on the Koran.
Jews are allowed to swear on the Torah.



Joke:
A lawyer once asked me 'Do I swear?'
I said 'all the fuckin' time.'
