Those at the top don't believe it.

At first this might be surprising to some.
Surely 'they loved the company so much they bought it'.
No, they didn't.
It is the same way a drug pusher does not use their own product but they sell it.
Many see religion as the ultimate scam and it attracts the worst people for this reason.
You can say things, get things, people trust you and no one can prove that you are being false.
But you may be thinking some are sincere.
Two pathways show themselves here:
  1) The originally sincere.
    These are the people who think it may be true.
    Most of these will not get promoted.

  2) Those who enter it thinking it is a scam.
    Such a person who does not get promoted (more status and money) will leave.
    Such a person may become a believer, some secular people use the image of 'drinking your own Kool-aid'

Promotion in a religious organisation comes only as a result of gaining followers.
To be successful in this enterprise you will want your followers to be sincere believers.
