Pascal's Wager

Is formed by the matrix of two questions:
1) Do I believe in God?
2) Does God exist?


Does God Exist?		Yes		No
I Believe in God
Yes			Heaven		Life wasted but OK.
			+99999999	-1
No			Hell		Life lived but ended anyway.
			-99999999	+1
Result:
Pay off for believing:		(+99999999 -1)/2 = +99999998
Pay off for not believing:	(-99999999 +1)/2 = -99999998
It is better to believe in God, heaven if your right and not much loss if your wrong
than to deny God, not much gain if your right and hell if your wrong.

But what happens if more than one religion claims this?
Eg. Christianity vs Islam.
Both claim the exclusive way to heaven and hell for everyone else.
The Matrix then becomes

This God is True	Christianity	Islam		Other
I Believe in this God.
Christianity		Heaven		Hell		Life wasted but OK.
			+999999999	-999999999	-1
Islam			Hell		Heaven		Life wasted but OK.
			-999999999	+999999999	-1
Other			Hell		Hell		Life lived but ended anyway.
			-999999999	-999999999	+1

Results:
Betting on Christianity:	(+999999999 -999999999 -1)/3 = -1/3
Betting on Islam:		(-999999999 +999999999 -1)/3 = -1/3
Betting on No God:		(-999999999 -999999999 +1)/3 = -1899999998/3

3 Mutually Exclusive Gods

This God is true:	1		2		3		None
I Believe in this God:
1			Heaven		Hell		Hell		Life wasted but OK.	
2			Hell		Heaven		Hell		Life wasted but OK.
3			Hell		Hell		Heaven		Life wasted but OK.
None			Hell		Hell		Hell		Life lived but ended anyway.
