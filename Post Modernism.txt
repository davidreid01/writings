Post Modernism

Is fundamentally anti-science.
Quote Wikipedia entry "Post Modernism ... denies objective reality exists"
The scientific method is to find out how reality works without regard to human opinion.
Compatible?
Not without considerable twisting of words.
Most would take 'objective reality' as the Universe's opinion.
If the Universe doesn't have opinions or view points then 'objective reality' could be said to be the rules by which the universe works.
It is the job of the post-modernist not ours to explain this.
It is impossible to believe in the scientific method and deny the existance of objective reality.
