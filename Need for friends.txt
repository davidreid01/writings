Need for friends

Loved ones and dependants can supply these but a dependant who is not seen as a friend does not.

Friends DO provide (simply by being a friend)
- a reason for you to persist.
	Without friends it is easy to quit.
	Knowing others will benefit from your success is a motivation not to give up.
- assurance of you place in society which is important for your self worth.

Friends CAN provide (the friend has to be active here)
- feedback, criticism, questioning to help you stay on track.

Those expelled from society become extinct.
