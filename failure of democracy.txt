failure of democracy

There are many issues in life.
You can vote for one candidate.
The elected representative (not necessarily the one you voted for) votes on decisions on your behalf.
Candidates present themselves as standing on one side of an issue but this is irrelevant,
if elected they then vote on decisions as they choose.
Nor can they fully represent voters.
Many voters with many views on many issues goes to one candidate who votes on decisions.
Several points:
1) Which candidate gets elected depends on the way people vote.
2) There is one and only one candidate elected, not 2 candidates, not 0 candidates, not half of one and half of another.
3) People do not control which way the elected candidate votes.
