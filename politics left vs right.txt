politics left vs right

There is a question that sorts out where you are on the right-left spectrum.
That is:
Am I my brother's keeper?
The left say "Yes", the right say "No".
The left care how others live.
The right believe in look after yourself.
The problem with this description of politics is it is based (and it is not entirely clear on whose) on intention.
It does not consider many things like:
Does the policy work?
Exactly who benefits and who loses and what is gained and lost by each person.

Another way of describing it is the left have morality but no sense and the right have sense but no morality.
Centralists often choose the worst out of both that is no morality or sense, usually however they choose a bit
of each regarding themselves as diplomats balancing either side.
They always choose the bits that profit their supporters.
We need both sense and morality, not all of one and none of the other and not a compromise of a bit of one and
a bit of the other.

Left vs Right when it comes to politics is an OVERSIMPLIFICATION.
Example: Left is supposed to support free speech.
Yet people have led others with the flag of the Left to riot against Rightist speakers.
If you say something I don't agree with then I am going to punish you.
People don't want to be punished and many will be silenced.
This is a violation of the principles of free speech.
