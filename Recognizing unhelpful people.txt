How to Recognize unhelpful people
The first thing you need is a purpose to accomplish not having this you will largely fail to recognize how people can be helpful.
It is the standard by which you need to measure them.
Even not having a major definate purpose some people rule themselves unhelpful in certain ways:
1) Not encouraging you to think for yourself.
This is largely because they are trying to sell you some form of pre-packaged thinking.
2) Not encouraging you to develop a major definate purpose.
Their speech and manipulation is just to get you to help with their purpose, nothing for you.

Today was Konami's 20th anniversary and I was publicly mocked.
"Here is a photo from 20 years ago" - not quite more like 18 but that is not much different.
"That is David Reid dressed for soccer. Here he is again with Fujisawa."
What has he done? What is he like now? Look, where are you?
My main problem is my lack of achievements during this time.
How could this problem have been avoided?
It could have been avoided if either:
They had:
* promoted individual competence by training and comparison for all from early on.
* had fired me early on or never employed me in the first place.

I had:
* recognized these people didn't care for anyone and I was responsible.
* recognized that I didn't believe in the product and should have got out.

So how did I get taken advantage of?
Simply I trusted people I should not have.
Believing things that were not real.

Warning signs:
1) No training or career development.
2) The product of the company was about duping people out of money.
There is no disguising this it should be obvious to everybody.



Concern: Talking to Glenn Macdonald.
I said "I was a joke then, I am a joke now."
He said "That's not true. You were seen as someone who had promise."

What now:

Dealing with reality.
