The truth of polygraph tests.

What is a polygraph?

"Poly" comes from the Greek for many.
A polygraph examines numerous biological signals.
The base line is formed by asking questions (answering some true, some lie) to establish what are the normal biological responses.

What a polygraph tests?
A poly graph tests biological response in answering the questions.
When the subject tells something they don't believe in (in other words a lie) as opposed to something they do believe in there will be
noticeable difference in biological response.

What a polygraph test does show and what it does not.
The biological response to a question will indicate whether the subject believes the answer, not whether the question is true.

A) Whether statement is true.
B) Whether subject believes it.

Polygraph results:
		A is false	A is true
B is False	Lie		Lie
B is true	Truth		Truth

A Polygraph test can only show whether the subject believes it not whether it the statement is true.
