the wall

Of Donald Trump's silly ideas the Mexican wall is one of the silliest.

Too keep out the pesky Australians let us build a wall around Australia and make Australians pay for it.
Don't worry if that is what you want, we will build a wall (out of concrete) and we will pay for it but
to save materials we will only build it around Donald Trump's head.

Let us give the Mexicans a brick, I wonder what they will do with it?
I think that the Mexicans might find a place for it.
Since the purpose is to stop evil from entering America maybe in Donald Trumps mouth would be an appropriate place.
