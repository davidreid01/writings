Pointless activity

Spend time and money in profitless activity and you will have nothing to show for it.

Profitless activities:

1) Working for someone else's business and not growing ie. either failing to accomplish what you want or improving your skill.
2) Fantasy - imagining some thing is true when it is not.
	Fantasies come in many forms, examples are:
		Pornography
		Computer games
		Fiction
		Religion
		Gambling
	Each of these has costs but do not deliver much reward, except to the vendors.
3) Recreational drugs.

Now some will argue that some of these have some benefit some of the time or in certain instances, the point needs to be made:
In doing these things you are not dealing with reality.

Hiding from reality is a problem.
Not dealing with reality is a problem.
