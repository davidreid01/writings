song lyrics are not the truth

Obvious.
Yet, some creedence is given them above straight statements.
How?
There is a false assosciation that goes:
I like the music.
I think the music is good.
Therefore the lyrics are good.
The lyrics are true.

See the error, just because the music is good does not mean the lyrics are good.
likewise if the music is bad it does not mean that it is false.

Examples:
1)
Professor of Physics Brian Cox.
Keyboard player of D Ream.
Famous song "Things can only get better."
Later said "That is untrue and the Second Law of Thermodynamics proves it."

2)
"I can see clearly now the rain has gone."
Really?
What if your blind?
How does the rain stopping enable you to see?

3)
"The Earth revolves around the Sun." (bad music)

Clearly no one will believe an obvious falsehood because of the music.
What is it that allows the subconcious mind to conflate the issues of the quality of the music and the truth of the musics lyrics?

This error is taken advantage of in advertising.

Solution to problem:
Think for yourself.
Ask is this true?
Public questioning is going to put a disincentive on those who try such thiings.
Who wants to be seen as one who promotes false belief?
