Pursuit of truth

You can tell whether a person is seeking the truth and whether they are concerned whether you are seeking the truth by what they say.
All people will want the truth when it comes to them making decisions but whether they want you to have the truth when you make decisions
is the determiner of how they regard you.
A person who wants you to have the truth will:
  will ask questions.
  preface statements that are unknown by the word "if".
  not deliberately use false statements.
  Have a focus upon the truth itself, not anyone's opinions.

A person who does not care whether you have the truth will:
  not encourage questions.
  refer to your belief not using "if that is true..."
  will use false statements to find out what you believe and whose next statements are based around whether you deny it.
  The focus is to win the argument.
  Making the other person look foolish is also an aim.
