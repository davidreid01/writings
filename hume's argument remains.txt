Hume's Argument remains:

Hume's argument runs like this:
1) I have known people who have told lies.
2) I have known people who have believed lies.
3) I have no knowledge nor any experience of what you say.
Which is most likely to be correct?
You are a deceiver (1), deceived (2) or are correct in what you say (3).
1 and 2 lead to believing in false things.
Only if 3 is correct is this the best path.
If 3 is incorrect either/both 1 and 2 are true.

How to determine if 3 is correct?
The first evidence available is the person you are talking to.
ASK: How do you know?
The answer to this will give you some indication.
Answer:
1) No answer. 
	The person will probably say something further/different as this is unnatural conversation flow.
	Either the person does not know or they are looking for someone who believes things without evidence.
	Result: DO NOT BELIEVE THEM.
	If you are a good person follow up by saying "You have not answered the question."
	This will give an opportunity for the person to realize 2 may be true about themselves or understand
	you will not be swayed if 1 is true.
2) Faith.
	I believe cause I believe cause I believe.
	This is a non answer as 1.
	There is a lack of evidence for you to decide act treat as 1.
	Ask (repeatedly) How do you know? 
3) Confusing reason.
	
4) Evidence requiring effort.
	
What is the cost and probability of finding the evidence against the consequences of believing or not?
Eg.
"Believe in God and live or don't and burn in hell"
The consequences might be dire but what probability do you have for finding evidence?
Perhaps none this side of the grave.

Hume scholars may (and should) point out that this is not precisely Hume's argument but:
1) There is a need for a precise, concise and contemporary argument.
2) It would not be right to leave unacknowledged the source of this "new" argument.
