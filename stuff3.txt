My Dad.
Did not work for a long time.
Did not develop useful skills beyond a minimum.
Did not help others.

Why?
He did not have hope that he could contribute anything useful. SPECULATION.
He did not seem to care about anything but himself.
	This leads to others not correcting him or helping him so he tried to do all the things he needed himself, the result was often mediocre.
It was a vicious circle.
The more he tried to do things himself, the more others watched and did not help.
He was struggling but no one seemed to care.
He was also making things more difficult for himself.
Regarding any act of help as an insult, responding to such help with argument and difficulty.

What failed.
Tough love was never given.
Sulky indifference - "if you are going to be like that..." - was the response to bad behavior.
A 'belief' of earning of being better than the others by hard work.
If someone does not work hard for any reason, that reason is not corrected.
The amount of 'hard work' the other does is considered a store of wealth against them.
The Protestant Work Ethic combined with a competitive society is to blame but the individuals are not innocent.

What is needed.
All people are not perfect, they need to be refined.
Refinement involves thinking, experience and external feedback.
In discouraging external feedback you miss out on much opportunity for refinement.
In not trying you miss out on experience.
In not thinking about what is involved important questions can not even be asked much less answered.
	Such questions as how can I do this better?
