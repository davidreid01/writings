Don't worry, your young.

Incidence:
An older man consoling a younger man.
Younger Man: I am 22.
Older man: Don't worry, your young.

After thinking about this, I have realized: it is appalling advice.
It may be that the older man knows no better, it may not be.
The younger man displayed that he was seeking validation or approval outside himself.
This is something he needed to leave behind in childhood.

Breakdown of the argument.
There are two components here:
1) Don't worry.
2) Your young.
Both of these points are reasonable or accurate.
Firstly, 'your young'.
This is a simple statement of fact but it is also relative.
The person referred to is younger than the speaker.
Secondly, 'Don't worry'.
Little good comes from worry itself.
Worry fixates on the problem but offers no solution.
Worry can paralyze you if you let it.
Yet combined it is very bad.
The point of worry is to highlight that there is a problem.
Your age is not an excuse to ignore a potential problem.
Waiting for problems to fix themselves is not a good idea.
Undealt with problems cause damage continually till they are fixed.
The continual damage of problems means that the sooner they are dealt with the better.
To advise a person to do nothing about problems is evil.
It is to promote destruction of that person.

What problems are there?
In this case, I didn't know the specific circumstances of the individual so I didn't say anything.




It could be that the older man held him in contempt and spoke sarcastically.
