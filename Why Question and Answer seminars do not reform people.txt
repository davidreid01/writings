Why Question and Answer seminars do not reform people

When an expert answers a question they use a short hand version (and why wouldn't they) of their own view.
The answer is based on an understanding and an argument which is not known, maybe not held by some and most importantly not a part of the question.
The expert pushes a proper answer into another area out of the scope of the question.
The questioner is given an answer to the question they asked but it raises the question somewhere else.
Examples:
1) A gender discussion: Why Dr. Jordan Petersen is fighting bill C16.
A Gender Studies lecturer claimed 'biological sex doesn't exist' and adds 'I can unpack that for you but in the interests of time I won't'
This is not a good example as nobody was convinced by this and the claim was not in a direct response to a question.
