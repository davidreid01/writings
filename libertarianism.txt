libertarianism

see teachings of Milton Friedman
Libertarian ideas assert that government programs always fail to deliver what is hoped by those who promote them.
Libertarian ideas assert that the 'free market' can better deliver what is hoped.

Why socialism fails?

Why government programs are grossly inefficient or even work against what is intended?

Why is the free market not always 'free'?


Free market requires:
Buyers to be able to choose between sellers.
Buyers being able to say no.
Sellers not being forced to accept too low prices(this is questionable definition).
Sellers being able to accept that their product lacks worth and they need to develop something different.

1) Everyone be able to choose what to agree to and no forced sales.
	No one is forced to buy. Eg. The thirsty person and the thousand dollar cup of water.
	No one is forced to sell. Your rent is due and I'll offer you 30 cents for this thing that usually sells for 30 dollars.

2) Everyone have sufficient knowledge to make decent deals.
