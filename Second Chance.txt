Second Chance

Have you ever heard the phrase 'deserve a second chance'?
This is just plain silly.
The idea that they get to make mistakes twice and be forgiven.
Maybe they mean two attempts this would only allow a first chance.
If so then they are saying it wrong.

Some do not get a first chance.
Some mistakes kill the people who make them, there is no chance, no second go, no way of
	fixing things up and trying again.
Some people get killed by other people's actions and mistakes.
What are you going to do about them? Blame God?
