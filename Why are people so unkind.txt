Why are people so unkind?

Life is competitive.
Wealth is available to be taken.
If you don't take it then you will die without heir or legacy.
If you don't defend your own wealth someone else will take it.
The notion that God will make everything alright after you die is unevidenced.
What we see is that when people die they no longer have any right to possession nor ability to defend the possessions and so they are
given to those that can.
Sometimes this is in accord with local law such as possessions given to family or redistributed according to a last will other
times it is simply taken.
We can see that a belief in divine restoration makes people easier to steal from.
"God will make everything better".
Unless God intervenes such a belief is disabling, making you less likely to defend your wealth.
