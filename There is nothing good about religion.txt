There is nothing good about religion.

Some common statements promoting religion:
1) Religion provides reason for morality.
What reason?
Do people become moral because God is watching?
Religion does not make people moral at all if they do not believe in God.
Are bad people supposed to become moral when they believe in God?
Can you give an example of this occurring?
Testimony:
	I used to be a bad person.
	I used to steal, do drugs, etc...
	Jesus redeemed me and I turned my life around.

2) Religion encourages morality.
See 1.

3) Religion does good things in the world.
Like what?
If the fundamentals of the religion are not good then it doesn't.
There are several problems with the idea of religion doing good things.
	i) 'Religion' does not do things.
		People who believe in the religion or not do things.
	ii) It is not necessarily the religion that inspires people to do good things.
		People do good things with or without religion, people do bad things with or without religion.
