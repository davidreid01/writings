Frustration

When things don't go your way you get frustrated.
What do you do at this point?

Search for the cause of the problem, decide what you will do and procede
OR
curse or blame or take revenge against inanimate objects.

It is of course the universe's fault that you are frustrated.
That seems silly from an outside view.
It is silly.
Attempting to change the universe to deal with your emotional problem is not going to work.
We need a detached emotional way to think through the issues.


Frustration tolerance.
You will be frustrated at times.
What will you do?
If the frustration is small you will:
	ignore your emotions
	learn about what prevented you from doing what you wanted.
	try to do it again with the knowledge you just acquired.
If the frustration is large you may unleash your frustration in bad behaviour, this may include:
	blaming something else.
		other people
		your tools
		your circumstances
		the universe in general
		evil spirits
	damaging things.
		nearby objects.
		your tools.
		some related object.
		nearby plants.
		nearby animals (this is very bad).
		nearby people (this is extremely bad). Parents have been jailed for shaking their baby.
	cursing
It should not take a master intellect to realize there are bad consequences that will result.
The point is nothing good will come from behaving badly.
You will have to accept any consequences of the bad behaviour.
