Not Being Selected.

Ever had the experience of not being selected?
In picking a football team the ones who seem the most competant in a required skill are chosen first.
The 'Winners', those who are higher up the social ladder than the selector are chosen next.
The others are chosen to fill the required number.
Once this number is reached the others are not chosen.

Several things become knowable in this.
Choosing selectors.
The usual aim is to assemble the best team, sometimes it is not.
To choose the best people the selector needs to:
1) know who has what skill and to what level.
2) be of sufficiently high social rank
	that others will respect their decision.
	that they will choose people only by what skills they bring.
3) be capable of understanding the goal and capable of saying whether it can be achieved.
4) be desirous of achieving the goal.

What does it mean to not be chosen?
1) The selector does not think you are skilled enough.
2) The selector thinks you are lower in social rank than the required positions.

Let us deal with the simpler problem first and put it out of the way.
The selector believes you are of lower social rank than the required positions.
Whatever your social rank is, if this is the reason you have not been chosen then you would not want to be a part of this team.
