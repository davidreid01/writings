Differences of the English language.

English English vs. American English
Australian english is far more like English english.

Things I find odd about American English:
Spelling of mom (American) vs mum (English).

Things I find good about American English:
Removal of unnecessary letters.
Instances:
	US program, UK programme - I very much like US. US development of computers means few use UK spelling.
	US color, honor, armor. UK colour, honour, armour.
		UK is habit but using more html, I no longer am adverse to US.
I believe simpler will take over from complicated.
	Some have already become part of the language used by everyone. eg. wagon where as the old UK method was waggon.
