Laws going wrong.

Laws are sometimes introduced to benefit one group at the expense of another.

Employment laws.

Minimum wage laws.
You must pay this amount (minimum) with these conditions (minimum) or you will be punished.
What is the effect of this?
Employers hire someone based only on whether the employees total cost is less than the profit their labour generates.
Supply, demand and competition effect the price offered to the employee.
So if the employees cost with these minimums is larger than the profit a job will never be offered.
If the market offers more than these minimums for someone's work these laws will have no effect.
Who benefits:
	The politicians who get the votes and support from those in favour of such law.
	Some workers will have their pay upgraded but ony those who pay was below the minimum and whose work will still
be profitable at the higher rate.
Who pays:
	A few employers whose workers pay was borderline and whose work is still profitable at the higher rate.

Unfair dismissal laws.
