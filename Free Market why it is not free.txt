Free Market why it is not free

A free market requires:
1) participants capable of buying and selling without being forced.
2) participants can effectively evaluate a trade and decide whether to go with it.

Are these requirements met?
1) Are people forced to buy or sell?
The thirsty person may desire to spend a lot more than usual.
The bankrupted person may be forced to sell their assets at a much lower price to attempt to repay the debt.
In some circumstances people are forced to sell.
Are people forced to buy?
The thirsty person is not forced directly to buy spending $3 for a bottle of water at Macdonalds.
What about indirectly?


2) Are all people engaged in the market wise in deciding what deal to go ahead with?
Consider smoking, we can say all people are not wise.
All people are not wise but are most of the people wise enough most of the time to make the 'free market' work?
