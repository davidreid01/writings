Questions and statements

If you don't know something then don't say it is so.
Seems common sense but this is often not practiced.
If you know you don't know then you will know if you have to answer 'How do you know?' then you will have to admit you don't.
If you don't know you don't know then ask yourself 'How do I know?' if you are unsure then now you know that you don't know.
Self Deception:
It is possible to believe you know and you know how to answer the 'How do you know?' question and be wrong on both counts.

Many people say things as statements but if pushed they will say they are just questions.
This is disingenuous, hoping the listener will trip up.
People who do this think they are being smart, they are not.
Point this out.
Make every listener aware of what they are doing.

Instead let your questions be obvious questions, you will not be mistaken as making a statement.
The question 'How do you know?' is not a good response to a question.

Why do people do it?
A person needs to contribute something to the discussion.
A response to asking the question is 'What have you done to find out?'
This will put the questioner on the spot as the answer to this is often 'nothing'.
A response to this answer could be 'so, it doesn't mean much to you'.
This is not a position the questioner wants to be in, fight or flight instinct may kick in, good will and nice feelings are gone.
To avoid this badness a person may make a statement rather than a question.
This is a bad move.
The person who does this may try to defend a statement believe is false.
A better way would be to counter the question 'What have you done to find out?' with
a statement 'you have made a claim, it is your requirement to back it up.' if they made a claim
or a another question 'If what you said is important don't you think finding out is important?'
