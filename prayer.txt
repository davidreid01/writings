prayer

What is prayer?

Prayer is defined as


What does prayer do?
It asks God for something or is a joining of the mind to the divine will.


Depending on whether God responds to prayer.

If God does.
	Who does God respond to?
		Christian:
			James?: "The prayer of the righteous has a powerful effect."`																																																					
			James:	"The double minded man should expect nothing from God."
	

If God does not.
	Maybe its because God does not exist.
	Maybe because it is you that are wicked and God does not listen.
	Combine two ideas from the Judeo-Christian tradition.
		1) God does not listen to the prayers of the wicked.
		2) No one is righteous, not one, all have turned away.
		Conclusion - God does not listen to anybody.
	How do theologians escape this conclusion?
		1) "listen" does not mean "hear" but "do".
		2) Wicked and righteous are not opposites.
			You are wicked if you choose evil.
			You are "righteous" if God makes you so.
