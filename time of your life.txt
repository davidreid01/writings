time of your life

You do not have much capacity to fully understand things until it is too late.
Why?
Full understanding comes with experience not simulation.
In a simulation you can choose again to get it right, experience gives you the consequences no chance to redo.
Without getting the consequences you will not experience what it is to experience the consequences.
Sounds bizarrely like chasing your own tail here, but there is an important point to be gathered.
You cannot experience the consequences and know there is no way of undoing the consequences in a simulation.
In a simulation you only imagine or project the consequences.

You seem down on simulation, is it of any use?
Yes, simulation offers a way of choosing the better path.
A simulation is a way of computing future consequences from present information.



Time goes a lot faster than you think.
Diligently persevere in developing your career and you will find that there is enough time in which to get things done
and reach some of you goals.
Drift, waste time and you will find there is not enough time to reach any of your goals.

A 10 Year old who does stupid things is funny.
A 20 Year old who does stupid things many people find funny but don't want to associate with them.
A 30 Year old who does stupid things is shameful.
A 40 Year old who does stupid things will not be helped, will be publicly spurned.

The time to correct things is now.
You cannot go back in time.
The consequences accumulate.
