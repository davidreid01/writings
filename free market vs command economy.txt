free market vs command economy


What about morons in the free market?

Don't we have a duty to care for the less well off? (including the financially irresponsible)
This is a curious question, does a thief have a duty of care for his victim? What about the rapist or the murderer?
This is one person putting their morality on another whose morality is very different.

Am I my brother's keeper?
The political left says YES the political right says NO.

A problem Leftist politicians promote government programs which libertarians say do not work.
I think the evidence supports the libertarians.
Cost is greater than the benefit.
Restrictions are placed with the aim of saving money but they only add to the overhead and deny some worthy people of the benefit.

Several things are fundamentally flawed.
1) Socialist politicians promote government programs conservative politicians try to restrict them.
The compromise ends up being a slight saving in there expense at the cost of preventing the benefit they were aiming for.
All politicians get to say they were doing something.
2) Unscrupulous politicians in order to gather the votes of the less educated, more gullible, poorer,
sell them lies.
