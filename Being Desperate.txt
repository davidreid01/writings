Being Desperate

When you are desperate you do dumb things.
Why?
You do not think things through.
You are hoping and trusting that things will turn out right.
If you guess correctly you will be OK but if you guess incorrectly you will be clobbered.
Deviant people are on the look out for people who trust and do not think and can often find an advantage
in the person guessing incorrectly then encouraging them to do it.
Likewise if they would guess correctly the idea will be taken and they will be encouraged not to do it.
So things often go worse for a desperate person than the idea that they come up with would indicate.

What is wrong?
When the person needs to do slow, deliberate, step by step thinking they do fast thinking.
Speed is important but not as important as getting things right.
The desperate person has put themselves in or allowed others to put themselves in the position of having to do fast thinking
when slow thinking is required.

The slow thinking needs to be completed before the decision is required.
When the decision is required only fast thinking will get it in time.

So what if you are required to make a decision about something you have not thought through?
Say no.
What if your in a bad position and saying no is difficult?
Ask yourself:
Am I used to saying 'no'?
	Many find it uncomfortable.
	You need to get used to it.
How did you get yourself in the bad position?
	Some elses manipulation?
	They couldn't have done it without you letting them.
