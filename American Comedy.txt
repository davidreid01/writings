American Comedy

I did not understand American comedy back in the 1980's.
Not until Seinfeld and the Simpsons did I think it any good.
A program that was a 'situational comedy' was 'Family Ties' this I didn't really think of as a comedy
despite it having an audience that laughed. I thought it more a drama and 'Hey this is how Americans live,
though they have more stuff they are a lot like us'.
The problem was not American comedy it was Australian TV programmers.
TV programmers were significant after the mass use of TV and before the mass use of the internet in the late 20th century.
At the time there were some really good American comedians Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Robin Williams and later Eddie Murphy to name a few.
TV programmers are members of that evil bunch of people who are not elite but serve the elite.
They are told what to do, are high in social status but the perk of the position is to be able to push others around.
My speculation is that they have little understanding about comedy and even less respect for the masses they 'serve'.
