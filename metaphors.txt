metaphors
also called analogies, similes, parables.
Yes, there are differences in these but they amount to very similar things.

When are they good?
1) When no simple explanation is possible.
2) When common people have no other reference to hang their intuition on.
3) The image used shows your point.

Why they should be avoided?
1) A metaphor pushed to far will imply things that are not meant.
2) A bad metaphor will put an image into the mind of the listener that will distract them from any point you wish to make.
3) Needing to explain a metaphor defeats the original purpose of the metaphor.

To whom you should not give a metaphor:
1) Unintelligent people - they will simply not get your point.
2) Literal minded people - the image will distract them from your point.
3) Antagonists, foes, enemies, people who deliberately misconstrue what you say to make you look a fool.
4) Slow thinking people - they tend to make up for being slow with great memory.
	These people will put it all together afterwards, explore the consequences of your metaphor, cannot be corrected and find holes in it.
	They will then think you are speaking falsely.
5) People who do not invest the time needed to understand your point.
Given that you usually cannot tell what state people are in and can never do so in the case of public communication then it is a mistake to use them.

But Jesus used them.
You are not Jesus.
Jesus used them of God, heaven, God's favor, God's plan, God's Kingdom these things are not physical, some would say not real but anyway there is
no evidence here and now.
The use of a metaphor to explain something that cannot be sensed, detected or demonstrated leaves that metaphor hanging with no connection for understanding.
One of Jesus metaphors "God is like a father" is really not useful for some.
"Well if he is anything like my dad he is an indifferent, lazy prick".
