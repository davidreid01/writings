Unasked questions.

Debate 'winners' do not let listeners think about questions that they do not have an answer for and
questions that do not lead into the point they are trying to make.

Example: the mass shootings in America
Stated aim of many - that such things do not happen again.
There are at least 2 questions to ask.
	1) How did a crazy person get access to high power weaponry.
	2) Why did the perpetrator do this?
The 'ban guns' group asks the first question and ignores the second.
	They may argue that if the first is accomplished the second is unnecessary.
The 'pro guns' group ignores the first question and only speculates about the second.
This may seem OK but you cannot ever guarantee 1.
There are many problems with solving this problem with 1.
One problem is defining things:
	What is a 'crazy person'?
		Certainly it would not apply to on duty police nor could it apply to on duty soldiers.
		Who gets to decide?
	What is 'high power weaponry'
Another problem is how is this rule going to be enforced.
