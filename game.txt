Randomness in games.
Certainty and uncertainty are aspects of games that seem antithetical.
Certainty				Uncertainty
reward follows effort			Some effort is unrewarded

Randomness in single player games.

Save and Load function enables the player knowledge of the future.
Don't like the result, quit, reload then do something else.

Having a new seed for the RNG enables a player to choose the future.
Don't like the result, quit, reload then try again, repeat.

Work arounds:
1) Saving and reloading the seed prevents the player from choosing the future but not
obtaining knowledge of the future.

2) Hard core - if you die you cannot reload the character from any save game.

3) Make reloading difficult.

Randomness in Multi-player games.




Things that make a game better or worse.
1) No 'debug' mode on commercial releases.
Hackers have ways of finding things out and posting on the internet the results.
Never Winter Nights was ruined for me when I found debug mode and could enter character data.

2) Do not waste effort on mini games which grow boring after thirty or so times
but the game will require they be completed many thousands of times.

3) A patch that prevents a players cheat may mean that player will hate the new version.
A problem in Mage Knight Apocalpse meant you could use your money to buy infinite potion ingredients,
make the potion and improve your stats. A patch fixed this, I never played it again.

4) Do not think that 'randomness' equates to infinite playability.
Diablo and Diablo 2 generated maps randomly but they were always looked similar.
Research -> what is the similarity pattern sub-conciously perceivable in a random generation.
