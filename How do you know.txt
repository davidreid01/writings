How do you know?

How do you know that you have received a revelation from God?
Answer it if you claim to know God.
Specific Revelations
1) Divine or Angelic visitations.
When did it happen? An out of the ordinary event would be memorable.
How did the entity appear? Eg. A large person like being in a glowing aura.
How did the entity communicate? Eg. voice, mind to mind.
How did you know the entity was speaking to you the truth?

2) Voices in the head.

Vague revelations.
1) The message is consistent with what I understand.
2) I had a dream.

It is poignant to note that the revelation is either specific or vague, not both.
The challenge is to get the person to question themselves.
This is not a bad thing.
If they come up with a good answer, good but I have yet to hear one.
They may have believed false things or have believed things without any evidence for believing them.
Their retreat position is I believe because I believe because I believe ... or it is a matter of faith.
Remember you can help them reform or you can win the argument but not both.
"I understand you want to believe that yet I see no good evidence for you to believe that."
Keep the emphasis on their thinking and do not insult them.
