identify a person when they are being obnoxious

A person is being obnoxious when:
(these are not the only time people are obnoxious)
1) They say a dubious thing then challenge you to disprove it.
2) They say a dubious thing then ascribe it to you, you are the source.
3) They do not follow logic in what they say but may do in what they think.
	Getting them to admit what they think is not worthwhile.
4) They say things to break the rhythm of your speech.
5) They confuse	your argument.

What is the aim of obnoxious people?
To make you look like a fool and promote their own point.

What are obnoxious people like?
It does not matter to them if:
	They are rude.
	They say false things.
the aim is to bring you down.

What to do about people being obnoxious:
(these are for a public discussion, what may occur in private may not be legal)
1) Deal with error and misinterpretation immediately.
	If it is your turn to speak 
	If someone says something false then say 'no' straight away.
	If someone says something dubious then say 'meh'.
	If someone persistently says something that you do not mean then repeat what you have said until the non obnoxious listeners get what you mean.
	If you need to respond with more than a one word answer you will break your rhythm in your speech.
2) Show the non obnoxious people that they are using bad tricks.
