The Great Wall of Trump

I wish the challenge was to build a wall around Australia to keep those pesky Australians out.
A wall that Australians had to build not pay for someone else to build.
A wall separating Australia from Trump.
How long do you think it would take Australians to figure out that a lot could be saved
simply by building the wall around Trump?
The wall might only need to be a metre or a yard long.
