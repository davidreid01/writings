major definite purpose

major
It will be the focus of your life.
It cannot be minor or just a hobby.

definite
It needs to be specific.
You cannot do something vague, you can only do definite things.
Ex.
not definite - "I will get more exercise."
definite - "I will run around the block."

purpose
What you are living to do?
What do you wish to achieve?


Choosing a major definite purpose.
The major definite purpose needs to satisfy these:
1) The major definite purpose must be your choice.
If you select what someone else says you will eventually rebel against it.
2) Provide what you need.
3) Provide some benefit to others.

Examples of major definite purposes:
1) To be a great musician.

Start with what you want.
Eg. Financial independence.

Remember you'll get nothing for nothing.
What benefit will I exchange for what I want?

All jobs become despicable without a major definate purpose.
