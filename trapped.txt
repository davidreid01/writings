Why I am stuck?

Parents:

Mother has 'Cinderella complex', that is the desire to 'earn' yourself into a superior position.
Such people work hard but do not teach.
'If you don't do it properly, I will and the credit goes to me.'

Father is a free-loader, that is someone who always allows others to do things for them.
He does not see that by not doing things for himself he develops no real skill and becomes more dependent.

They are co-dependent, her need for importance keeps providing and his inability keeps him from any independence.
They may say this is marriage and there are benefits in specialisation but they are hiding from the problems.
