The nature of People

To get more, to be more, to avoid pain and to maximise pleasure.

Remember the board game 'monopoly'?
Everyone starts out even.
Have a victory and you become more capable and it makes it more likely that you will get another victory.
Have a loss and you become less capable and it makes it more likely that you will get another loss.
What happens is that if played to completion, is that:
1) One person ends up with all the money.
2) Everyone else has none.

In the game of life, money is the way you keep score.
