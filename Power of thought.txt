Power of thought.

This article focuses not on what can be accomplished rather on how thinking can be prevented or side lined into
keeping a person from achieving.

1) Problems not dealt with that can be fixed.
If there is a problem that you think you can fix but don't then part of your brain is going to continually remind you.
This is a mind expenditure you will have to pay over and over again.
Solution: Put effort in to solve the problem.
A solution will mean you don't have to keep paying.

2) Problems that can't be fixed that occupy too much thinking.
Some problems cannot be fixed (at least by you).
It is not worth spending too much time thinking about these unless:
  *) they are part of your life's quest.
    You have decided that your life's goal is to look for an answer to this question.
If you think a problem cannot be solved by you then either:
  you need to place it in the not important category  of things and not think about it.
  OR
  you need to give it a very low priority and not think about it.
    
So how do you decide whether a problem needs solving?

3) Filling your mind with junk.
