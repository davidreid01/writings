Predators, ordinary and altruistic people

These are the way people behave and not the type of person.
A person may be one thing to one person and another thing to a different person.

Predators regard the other as a resource to be used then dumped when the value is extracted or there is little
possibility of extracting any resource.

Ordinary people do not want to commit evil or have their mind contaminated with the idea that they have committed evil.
However, they will not risk themselves to stop a predator or correct the fool who believes lies.

Altruistic people will risk themselves to stop a predator and will assert the truth as they see it.

So we see a spectrum with predators at one extreme, who do not care if they damage their own mind in order to achieve over others
to the altruist who will sacrifice themselves for the sake of others.
All people will want to be seen as altruistic regardless of what they are.
