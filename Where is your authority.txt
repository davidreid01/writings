Where is your Authority?

What do you mean by that?
Have you thought about the issues?
	Yes.
What if you are wrong?
	I might be and are probably wrong.
If you are wrong why should I listen to you?
	I am not issuing you a command.
	I do not know if I am wrong.
	What evidence do you have that I am wrong.
	These issues are important, the way we live life is based on them.
	If I am wrong you can point out why and I can improve.
	Without this feedback I will not improve.
	For you, in developing a counter argument, you will be thinking thru the issues and your reasoning about that subject will improve.
	Do you want to get better?
	Do you want to improve?
	Do you want to find out possible errors in your own thinking?
	If so, listen and think, do not trust and obey.


Now let me question you. (This statement promotes a 'no' response and a likelihood of the audience tuning out).
Are you prepared to believe someone because you have attributed authority to them?
