Bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people.

What happens to people is no indication of whether the people are good or bad, or God's favour or not.

Movies based on computer games are rubbish as are computer games based on movies.
Why? The owners of the 'brand' are focussed on getting return on investment not producing quality.
When something has no 'brand' it is only financially successful for its quality.
When something has a 'brand' it is less dependant on quality.
Furthermore, if something without 'brand' has poor quality you will not hear about it.
If something has 'brand' and poor quality, the investors will still want a return and hype it,
calling in favours from media owners.
