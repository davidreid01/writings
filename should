Should.

Do not ask 'should' questions till 'is' questions have been worked on.
  The conversation is inadequate while the status of the 'is' question has not been addressed.
  The status of the 'is' question is either will be definite answer to solve later.
Do not use 'should' questions to determine the answer to 'is' questions.
  This is where real obnoxiousness comes in.
  The truth of the 'is' question is not dependent on answer to a 'should' question.
  Anyone's opinion does not determine how things are.
  People who do this are seeking victory over others, to promote others submission to the group over the truth.
