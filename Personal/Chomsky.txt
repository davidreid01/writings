Chomsky

I recently heard a YouTube (need ref). video of Chomsky where he said in response to an interviewers question:
I: Isn't Islam the biggest threat against civilization?
C: Christianity is bigger.

What does he mean?
Civilization means what exactly?
'Biggest'? What are you comparing by this?
This seems like a throwaway answer to a bad question.
It is a problem with both religious and anti-religious people that they think they are promoting their view point by making
statements that assume things but give no reason as to why.




Anarcho-syndicalist?
Most people don't know what this means.
