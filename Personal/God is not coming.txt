God is not coming.

When you see mistakes you committed in the past that you at the time did not know better.
When those mistakes lead to consequences that cannot be overcome.
When the present is beyond your ability to repair.
Where was God?
If God loved you would He not warn you not to do this error.
Many times when you look back you will see your own errors but many times you will not.
Where was God when the crucial decision was made that only later you could see the error?
How do you know?
How does God reveal Himself to you?
If God really loved you then why does he not point out your mistakes?
If you say God is delivering the consequences of peoples actions, then what is special about you
  that would lead you to the idea that God loves you?
