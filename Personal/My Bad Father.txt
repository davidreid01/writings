My Bad Father

Speculation:
He is driven by the want to be superior to others.
He would rather be on the losing side with someone else to blame than on the winning side if he wasn't recognized as the bringer of the victory.
He puts enough effort in firstly to avoid blame but more importantly to have someone else to blame.

It should be noted here that it is easier to lose than to win.
There is much competition to win and little to lose.
Losing requires far less effort and is far more certain than winning.
'It's not my fault'. This is his motto and the motto of all losers.
'I can only do my best', I heard him say recently.
  In the movie 'Rock' Sean Connery's character says 'losers whine about doing their best'.

I cannot tell whether he is evil or genuinely ignorant.
He seems willfully ignorant, he always tries to win an argument or discussion.
His motive for everything seems to be to avoid blame.
Truth seems irrelevant to him, if anything goes wrong it is some else's fault.
Things do go wrong, entropy alone wears things down and they fail.
The better response is to keep the things used in good condition and be capable of replacing them when they fail.
Yet he does little as possible in his own interest and nothing for others.
He has no substantial achievements - how does anything you can name help other people significantly?
