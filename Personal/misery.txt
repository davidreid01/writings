Misery

This is the name of a Stephen King novel and a subsequent movie.
In the movie Kathy Bates played a psychologically disturbed ex-nurse by the name of ... .
The psychological disorder she had was a dependency on being needed which manifested itself
so much that she kept a crash victim physically incapable by smashing his ankles when he had recovered
enough to leave. She satisfied her addiction in a terrible way.
The man was trapped by her addiction to caring needing to inflict injury to keep him that way.

The extreme of going to that length is not common but the desire to be valued and that way of thinking is common.
A child can be kept infantile by a 'needy' mother.
The mothers own desire for significance means their is a motive for keeping the child dependant.
The presence of a father is to keep this from happening.
But not if the father is absent.
The father can be either physically absent or just indifferent.
In this case it is all up to the mother.
She must guard herself from this danger.

Many will not know there is a danger.
The danger is mostly for the child.
The child being protected, will become weak and not able to do things that they ought to be able to do.
The weak child will eventually despise what the mother has done.
The mother's desire is to nurture the child.
Without an effective father the mother will likely do this.
Am I against single mothers?
No, but the absent father has consequences.
Can women prevent this from happening?
Yes, they need to think things through or they will end up doing it.
