Gabriel Tanna,

Gab,
	Hope things are going well.

I've come to realize many things.
Yet doing your own thinking is probably the greatest of these.
In doing my own thinking I've started asking all sorts of questions.
These questions will remain unanswered till someone searches for and discovers the answer.
That person is me, after all they are my questions.
Obvious, but things that are obvious to one person are not necessarily obvious to another.

One issue that has been raised by writers and comedians is false statements by politicians and who is responsible.
George Carlin - where do these politicians come from: American schools, American universities, American families.
	That's right we breed them. (need proper ref.)
Stephen Fry:

There is enough guilt to go around for everyone.
If they are rewarded for being dishonest should we be surprised if the successful ones are?

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. expressed the problem a little differently:
	They do not care about the Ten Commandments, only the eleventh "Thou shall not get caught".
	This attitude more than anything is responsible for the mess we are in.
	(need proper ref.)
Do you have any thinking on this?
If it is to be read it needs to be precise, concise and memorable.

I intend to put all these questions on a website where anyone can view and comment at their leisure or not at all
if they can't be bothered.

I wish this email was more positive but I'm still in a dark place.

David.
