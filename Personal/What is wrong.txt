What is wrong?

To even ask this question requires that:
1) You can think of a situation that could be better.
OR
2) Realize that the current situation is not perfect.

My Parents:
Dad:
	Is indifferent, selfish.
	Not foresighted.
	May think 'at least I'm better than him.'
	I don't think he realizes how others view him.
	Is delusional.
		Takes as compliments sarcastic statements.
			Particularly in regard to his train set.
	Seems not to understand that your reward comes from other people giving you in response to what you give them.
		There is no free lunch here.
		You can make some ground at others expense for a short time until they realise you are not going to pay them back
			then they will cut you off.
		Any advance at others expense is just using up trust they may have.

Mum:
	Tries to 'earn' her way by diligent work.
	Is negative - puts people down.
		'You will never ...'.
			'get another full time job' to my father.
			'be on Master Chef' to me in trying to learn to cook.
	Maybe its her way of believing she is superior to others.
	Maybe she thinks she can reform people by sarcastic comments or by a good example without explaining any reason why.
		It does not work, it always comes across as 'I am better than you' and will be subsequently rejected.
	Never gives feedback to others without any effort to consider the other persons ego.
		If its bad she will say so. If its good she will say nothing.
