Marxism

Is a religion without God.
The religion you have when you don't have a religion.

Why?
a) It has beliefs which are undemonstrable.
	What beliefs?

b) It requires people to believe things whether or not they are true or that the people have any evidence for them.

c) It punishes people for not believing the doctrines and rewards them for adhering to them.
	Punishment can range from simple shunning the offender (cut them off from social contact) to worse.
	Reward is mostly in the form of praise and acceptance.
		There is another form of reward that will be described later.
d) It does not encourage questioning of the core beliefs.
	This is the guts of religious teaching - do not think for yourself, I will give you thoughts to think.
	Think and study to your hearts content but only approved books, teachers and literature.
	Reminiscent of bible study or learning the Koran.
	By the way my study did not come without effort please donate.

e) People are promoted because of their ability to bring others in.
	This in money making scams is called 'pyramid selling'.
	Preach successfully and you will gain followers who can learn to preach.
	All the believers become the workers who donate their time, money and effort to support the pyramid.
	Get promoted and with that you get respect, money and power - the pyramid grows itself.
