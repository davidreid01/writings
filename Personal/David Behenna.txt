David Behenna

I last night (4/7/2017) talked to David Behenna.
from that I now realize
*) he asked a lot
*) I talked a lot
What do I remember of learning from him
Not much.
Be Specific.

Where does he now work
	Don't know.
What is the name now of his company
	Don't know.
What personal study did he do to ask such insightful questions
	Don't know.

See there is a lot you don't know and you didn't put a high priority on finding out because:
	1) I had not thought of asking the questions beore hand.
	2) I wanted to opinionate, give my views on something.

The more I think about him the more I believe he held me in contempt and long did.
I think he was really the only chance I had at getting a mentor.
He gave me a task, read a book on the windows operating system.
He said it would open windows up to me.
I didn't read it and returned the book half a week later.
This was a test to see if I had the commitment. I failed it.
I didn't know that this was a test but I had shown him almost nothing.
Students must seek out mentors, not the other way around.
Students are the ones who need to learn, mentors do not need to teach at least they don't need
specific students.
Why did I not know?
1) No-one told me.
2) I did not seek that information myself.
3) I did not know that I needed to seek that information myself.
Further Analysis
1) alone is a pure whinge.
2) maybe accepting some if not most responsibilty.
3) plus 1) and 2) absolves me of responsibility but not consequence.
So what if I can blame others but get the consequences anyway?
Responsibility is nothing, consequence everything!
