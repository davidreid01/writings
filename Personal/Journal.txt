I am very down.
No friends, no lover, no property and very soon no job.
A job I hate.
  Reasons for hating the job:
  1) It is parasitical. The way the 'company' gains money is by selling a product that takes advantage
    of people being unwise. It encourages unwise behaviour in its victims. Chiefly gaining wealth by
    encouraging moral corrupt people to prey on victims.
  2) It is political and the people there take advantage of unwise people.
Held in contempt by most.
I do not do what I want to do.
  Every time I go to do something whenever I face a difficulty there are reasons to quit and I quit.
  I do not cave in at first but eventually I do.
  There are many people who are downers.
  People who present reasons to quit.
  Sarcasm is something that should be very obvious.
  It is not obvious to me and the reason I believe is the religious indoctrination that God will make it all right.
  This wishful thinking that because I am trying to overcome my sin other people are trying to overcome their sin
  is just not true and bad logic.
  It prevented me from seeing that they are bad or opportunistic people looking for a sucker to take advantage of.
