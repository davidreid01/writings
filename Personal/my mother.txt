my mother

is very evil.
why?
She is negative.
	She does not inspire anyone to do anything good.
She keeps people down.
	Taking opportunities to acrew status by work yet preventing others.
	Encourages others to be dependent on her.
She is sarcastic.
	Responds with petitions to teach with insult and an offer to do the thing.

She works to promote herself over others.
	'I am better than you' summarizes her behaviour.

Recently she has cooked some cakes, she has made pancakes and banana fritters.
	I did not see any joy in these making.
	She was methodical as in I have made a plan and are carrying it out.
	This is OK but she did not speak about why.
	It was as if she was doing her duty and that she was earning credits for it.
	'See what a wonderful person I am'.
	There was no 'I am enriching others'.

is vengeful
	and patient in that revenge.
	Someone who knows what is bad but never lets the other know.
	To be able to say 'Look, you caused the disaster' and being able to point to her 'hard work'.
	I have realized that from the earliest days she did things for me, not showing me how to do them and then making me do them.
	This is the act of someone who hates you and/or is trying to keep you dependent.
	At the time I did not realize but I am confident she did.
	Andrew at some time would have realized what she was doing and countered it.
	He might of even seen it as a test to improve him.
	Andrew was late in achieving 'independence' by that I mean owning his own land and making all of his own decisions.
	I think he saw what was happening to me and thought 'no, I don't want that'.
