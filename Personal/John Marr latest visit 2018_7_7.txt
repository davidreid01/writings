John Marr latest visit 7/7?

ME: Americans were given the choice of voting between a liar and a crook.
JM: Who is the liar?
Me: Trump.
JM: So you are saying Hilliary is a crook.
JM: People so easily believe Trump's lies.
JM: Hilliary is not a crook, she has never been convicted or even accused in such a way that legal acts must ensue.
ME: I have not swallowed Trump's lies.
JM: If there was any case where Hilliary could have been convicted, Trump would have pursued it.

Reflections:
I felt bad, he was saying that I was both wrong and stupid.
He was just opinionating, he wasn't interested in finding any evidence about anything.
Whether he had a fixed dichotomous opinion by that I mean if Trump is bad then Hilliary must be good, I am not sure.
Furthermore he gained a social victory over me and that is what I think he really wanted.
But not the only thing, I also think that he is or wishes to be part of 'team establishment' and Hilliary was their candidate.
