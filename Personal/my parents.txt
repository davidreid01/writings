my parents

It is my Birthday 12 September 2017, I am now 45.
I have very little to show for it.
Nothing of any great significance.
No career, no marriage, no kids, no property.

How did this come about?
Not having a plan.
Not working out the plan.
Not reviewing the plan.
Not reforming the plan.
Not continuing to work out the plan.

These are my fault.
Did I know that that was what was required.
No.
Where could I have found out?
Being 'christian' it only was the bible and then only the sections I heard and read.
Other 'christians' would promote only the bible and commentaries and speakers that agree with them.
Other ideas could be read or studied but they would have ideas that conflict.
This would lead to ridicule first at the ideas then at me so I didn't study other ideas.
Such arrogance to read Russell who wrote 'Why I am not a Christian' when you should be studying the bible.
The bible has in the Hebrew section a book called Ecclesiates, a book about wisdom.
At the end it says that no one can know wisdom that the only wise thing to do is to trust God.
I hope you can see an easy path for fraudsters.
The separation of people from knowledge that can free them.
The priest steps between people and God.
It even mentions it in the bible see the book of Samuel with the sons of Eli treating the priesthood as
a business to free load off the believers.
The priest is motivated to keep the believers ignorant.
Lest the believer discovers that they no longer need the priest, the middle man has been cut out.
This happens in (usually one) of two/three ways.
1) God reveals Himself directly to the believer. 
2) The believer no longer believes in God




What a pretend we have in Jesus.
