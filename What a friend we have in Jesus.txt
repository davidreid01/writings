What a friend we have in Jesus

Good friends will support you and always push you to be a better person.
	That means they will point out your weaknesses and where you can improve.
Bad friends will support you but prevent you from being a better person.
	That means they will try to keep you weak.

Enemies will take advantage of your weakness.
	You are irrelevant. Their profit is what matters.
	Enemies will pretend to be friends.
	Enemies may support you if they believe it leads to their further advantage.

So what is Jesus?
Is Jesus your friend?
	He is no friend if he doesn't support you in your weakness.

Is Jesus your enemy?
	He is no enemy if he doesn't take advantage of your weakness.
