Move and Fire

Someone who doesn't like you will keep you pinned down unable to move.
This is like a soldier being pinned by enemy fire.
They cannot move without being shot.
All the while other enemy soldiers will be moving to get into a position to shoot that soldier.
Eventually they will die as other enemy soldiers get into a position to be able to shoot them.
It is the path of bad people to hit the one they don't like, then hit them again, keeping them off balance.
