rascism

Definition:


Is Australia rascist?
No and not because any body is or is not rascist but because this question is confused.
'rascist' is a characteristic of people.
'Australia' is a land, or a country, or a nation or a continent.
Maybe they mean Australian people.
If they do they should say so and remove the confusion.
Rephrasing.
Are Australian people rascist?
Better but still the question is ambiguous.
Do you mean:
	are all Australian people rascist?
	are some Australian people rascist?
	is the elite of the Australian people acting in a way that is rascist?
	are visitors to Australia likely to experience rascism?
