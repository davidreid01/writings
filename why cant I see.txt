Why can't I see?

Cutting yourself off from different ideas.
The internet has not merely allowed ideas to flow around the world easier but has allowed people to cut themselves off
more effectively.
WHY?
There is a tendency to only chat with people who have the same ideas as you.
There is a tendency to watch only videos that you agree with.
Advertising is catered to what you are more likely to be interested in from the cookies of sites you have visited or you tube videos
you have watched.
This makes sense, why advertise to people who are probably not interested.
This increases the isolation you have, not confronting new ideas.
In pre internet days you could talk to the guy in the next apartment
and the news channel that you watched was programmed by the corporate owner, not optimised for your prejudices.
This did not mean you had to think for yourself but there was more to challenge your views.

Thinking your teaching someone else when you need to be learning from them.
Eg. proselytyzing religion.
I was asked the question 'How do you know?'
I never answered this question instead I kept trying to convert them.
I was not going to get anywhere until I had a good answer to this question.
I did not have a good answer to this question so I did not answer it and did not convince them of anything.
This failure might have been bad for the church, this guy refused christianity, so my role was to move on and try someone else.
BUT
I did not learn nor did I question my own belief at the time.
YET
I did remember this question and I remembered that I had no good answer for it.

When later I questioned christianity no one had ever given me a good answer to it.
