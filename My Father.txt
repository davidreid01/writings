My Father

Is deluded.
He now realizes he has to contribute something.
But he is over 70 has not worked for decades and has little (or no) commercially viable skills.
That is he cannot even sell his knowledge which is mostly little supported opinion.
How did this come about?
1) No help from others.
The first help a person can and should be given is the truth.
If a person is believing false things then this is an opportunity for them to grow.
The first question that you need to ask yourself is do you want to help this person?
Many don't and some plan to ruin the other person. 
Q. How does one overcome a persons ego and self respect?
A. Are you out for an ego victory over them?
	If you are you will get nowhere and they will want you to leave.
   The short answer is you do not need to overcome their ego.
	If you don't work with their ego, you wont get anywhere.
Q. Wont this be seen as an attack and subsequently disregarded?
A. This is the art, you are not attacking them and you need to make it appear that you are not attacking them.
Q. Why help somebody who does not ask for help?
A. You must distinguish here between someone who does not ask for help, someone who does not want to be helped and someone who will
retaliate if you try to help them. These are all different.
Many people who need help do not realize that they need help.
Tactlessly given help will come across as an "I am better than you." statement.

2) 

Has done nothing for me.
