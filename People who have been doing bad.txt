People who have been doing bad.

My brother Andrew.
1) Offers others to help him but gives nothing in return.
	Some peope offer lunch in exchange for several hours of labour.
	This is low pay but it is pay.
	Is it his own choice to do this? likely.
	Does he offer the minimum of what he thinks someone will go for?
		If they are prepared to accept only words is that what he gives?
