debating not so good

Ever think "I wish I said that" but the opportunity to say anything is over.
This is common with debates and conversations as they are fixed in time.
It is impossible to go back in time and say something different.
The most you can do is admit you were wrong about such and such and say it differently.
You can win a debate with bad reasoning easily if the audience does not think things through.
When people do not think for themselves they default to whatever prejudices they have.
Thinking things through takes mental effort and someone who talks fast can prevent a proper analysis from being done.
This technique can easily be spotted and it can be pointed out that it fails to convince people.

The speaker communicates.
The listener hears.
The listener thinks about what is said.
The listener responds.
The speaker hears the response.
The speaker responds to the response.
The listener hears the response to the response.
The listener thinks about the response to the response
And that is it.
That is if there are questions then it stops with the listener thinking about things.
The listener then goes back to their life and may forget much of what is said.
If questions are allowed the listener may not have had the time to think things through and not have composed a question for the speaker.

The dialogue is stifled by Ego promotion and Ego protection.
Stifling by Ego Promotion
The speaker may crush dialogue by humiliating or intimidating the listener.
The speaker does not want to look foolish for 
Stifling by Ego Protection
The listener may develop a useful question that the speaker needs to hear but may keep it to themselves.


Writing presents different options.
You can edit, rewrite and have someone else check before you publish.
Reading takes mental effort and someone who can't be bothered thinking things through will not engage with it.
They will only read things that agree with what they already believe.
