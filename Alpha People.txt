Alpha People

Alphas come in two varieties alpha male and alpha female.
Why?
  The biological drive to propagate the species.

What makes an 'alpha'?
  An alpha is recognized by non-alphas as being what is great.
  A person who embodies the characteristics that are desired.

All alphas have the following characteristics:
  *) Above average beauty.
  *) Above average intelligence.
  *) No obvious flaws.
  *) No medical, emotional, physical or mental disorders.
  *) High in social status (if not the top).

One description a guy gave of Laura Branigan after a you tube video of 'Gloria':
  'My sister wanted to be her and I wanted to be with her.'
  This says alpha female.

One way of knowing an alpha is their effect on the opposite sex.
The presence of an alpha female will make most guys go 'wow' and try to do their best.
The presence of an alpha male will turn most ladies on and they will compete for his attention.
