Deriding Derrida

(Research Derrida, Binary Thinking)

Much of life is presented to us in 'binary opposites'.
If you are for one side then you must be opposed to the other.
If you are opposed to one side then you must be for the other.
Who determines these 'opposites'?
The most evil example is politics.
The left would have you help your neighbour.
The right would have you not force your neighbour.
Most would admit that it is good to help your neighbour and not force them.
This is both left and right at the same time and cannot exist.
The presentation of binary opposites is used to bring people under one banner.
People are then required to choose one side or the other.
This means they choose the side that presents the issue that matters most to them and they have to be silent on an issue
that is presented by the other side even if that issue matters to them.
To do otherwise is to not be a 'proper' part of the 'us' team.
A person persuaded to be a 'leftist' ignores the part of them that says do not force your neighbour.
Jean Jacques Rousseau - "They will be forced to be free".
A person persuaded to be a 'rightist' ignores the part of them that says help your neighbour.
The moral coward will say to themselves - "I don't make the rules" all the while collecting whatever benefits they can.

This is bad but don't worry, it gets worse.
These 'binary opposites' that people are bullied into and do not really believe are used by the deconstructionists
as evidence of bad thinking and why other people are stupid.
This leads to the post-modernists to believe they are superior and enlightened above others.
Derrida is guilty of a scam here.
Encouraging people to believe that they are better than others when they are not.
