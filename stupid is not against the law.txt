stupid is not against the law

bad thinking is responsible for much destruction and bad things but it is not prohibited by law.

Why?

1) People make money out of others thinking dumb things.
Consider fraud.
If everybody engaged in critical thinking then people would not fall victim.
It would be without profit.
People wouldn't do it.
Example:
Selling cigarettes.
If nobody smoked there would be no market.
No market, no profit.
No profit, no seller.
People who make money out of things will vehemently oppose anything that restricts the money flow to them.

2) It doesn't solve the problem.
Making a law doesn't solve any problem.
Ever.
Are foolish people going to become wise because you say that something is bad?
No.

So why do we have such laws as "Don't drink and drive"?
Laws need to be specific and testable as well as having a purpose.
The purpose of this law is damage minimisation.
