What I learned from:

Ben Shapiro:
	A public debate is a popularity punch up.
	The quest for truth may be a noble endeavour but it is not what a debate is about.
	It is about Social Rank and the object is to make the other person look foolish.
	"Embrace the fire", "It's OK because you know how to punch."

Jordan Petersen:
	To have a meaningful life what you do must matter.
	Male dominance hierarchy exists and is evolutionarily derived.
	Female sexual selection is based on the male dominance hierarchy.
