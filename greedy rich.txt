greedy rich.

Combine the ideas:
1) "You just don't get it. It is about winning." - Starship Troopers - "Rico" - Robert Heinlein.
2) Money is the way you keep score.
This leads to:
1) More money for me is good.
2) Less money for me is bad.
3) I don't care as long as the result is more money for me.

Bertrand Russell
"The bigs hit me, I hit the babies, that's fair." This epitomises the history of the human race.
One thing the rich can't stand is that the poor should have leisure.
Next to having pleasure for ourselves is denying pleasure to others or more generally the acquistion of power.

Machiavelli
1) This generalisation is true, men are liars, fickle, greedy for profit and fearful of danger.
They are with you while danger is remote, when danger approaches they turn away.
2) The nobility seek to oppress the people. The people seek not to be oppressed.

F. Scott Fitzgerald
The rich are very different. The rich have early on ..... this makes them soft where we are hard, cynical where we are trusting.

Note:
1) There is no upper limit to acquistion, you can always get more.
Do you have the largest house?
Do you have the most expensive house?
Have you got onto business/forbes top 500?
Are you position number 1?
How secure are you in position number 1?
Will your successors retain this position?
Eg. Alexander the great. Never lost a battle, won by strength and skill a huge empire.
Never conquered China, did he know about it? He'd be a fool not to.
The army was war weary and wanted to go home.
He got sick and died.
His successors split his empire up and did not continue conquering.

2) Selfishness not wealth is greediness.
It is the attitude of more for me, you do not matter.

3) Starving people think nothing but food.
People who are focussed on area are not looking at other areas and can easily be duped.
Starving people will pay whatever to solve the problem.
They have no bargaining power.
