Free loaders and tight arses.

What is a free loader?
A free loader is one who takes but does not give.
As long as there is a perceived gain with zero responsibility a free loader will take it.
This is closely related to being a tight arse.
A tight arse is one who accepts a deal that seems in their favour and costs them little but rejects anything else.
Tight arses are more suspicious than free loaders.
They both have the common problem of not seeing any worth in the 'team'.
The discussion from here will treat them as the same.
Free loaders come in two forms:
1) The Total free loader:
	a) do not consider the 'team' ever.
	b) have no allies.
	c) do not trust anyone.
	This is a psychological corruption.
2) The Limited free loader.
	Limited free loaders choose friend and foe.
	The limited free loader will act like a free loader to those they consider foes but not to friends.
