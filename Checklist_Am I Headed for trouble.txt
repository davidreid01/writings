Checklist
Am I Headed for trouble?

1) Can you say your definate major purpose?
If not then do you have a definate major purpose?
Failure to have a definate major purpose means you will drift through life and end up losing your source of income which you will despise.
Write it down, it should be only a single sentence.

2) Are you making progress on your definate major purpose?
Look back at the last month, what progress have you made?
Not enough? Is it your definate major purpose?
Are you putting in sufficient effort considering it is your sole focus in life?
Napoleon Hill: "Never let a single day go by without some progress on your definate major purpose."
It is to be noted as a warning if a single week goes by without you being able to write of having achieved some minor goal toward
your major definate purpose.

3) Do you have good friends?
Good friends always push you to be a better person, bad friends, enemies and those indifferent to you do not.
Good friends will point out your mistakes and areas that can be improved, bad friends, enemies and those indifferent to you will not.
Bad friends may pick you up when you are down but they will keep you from becoming better.
By this definition God is not my good friend nor is Jesus.
