End the pretend

One great problem of the human race is the ability to pretend and the willingness to pretend things are some way
when there is no evidence for it.

Where does this ability come from?
Evolution has developed in human brains the ability to simulate reality.
To allow us to ask questions like:
	what if this happens?
	if everything is held the same except for this one thing being different, what would result?
To be able to simulate reality gave a powerful advantage to those that could do it.
If you wanted to find something out then you could think through the potential costs of trying to find out before doing it.
Is this advantageous? Here is an example:
Is there a crocodile in the river?
Not sure, then don't go swimming.
In France you may think there are no crocodiles around here so it is OK.
In Egypt you may think there are crocodiles around here so it is not worth the risk.

Sounds good, I want this feature of imagination.
Where does it go bad?
Hang on, what is involved in this?
You are making a decision based on previous developed ideas and calculating the risks.
If you have inaccurate information you are making a decision on bad data and are more likely to come up with the wrong answer.
The wrong answer could get you eaten.

Where does pretend come in?
If you want a particular answer you may distort the data or the ideas to get it.
Pretend is about imagining that something could be true.
You can just change the data you have, it is in your brain and come up with any answer you like.
Don't do it.
Your data may be faulty and almost certainly is incomplete but making the data fit your desired outcome defeats the whole
purpose of being able to simulate.
