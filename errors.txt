People do not fix up their errors.
Why?
1) They do not recognize that their is an error.
2) They pretend there is no error.

What needs to be done.
People need to look to see if there is an error.
Not looking/testing to see if there is an error is a mistake.

Ego
Ego requires intelligent treatment.
Ego is your source of self respect, without it you may as well be dead.
