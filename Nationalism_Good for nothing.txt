Nationalism_Good for nothing

What is nationalism good for?

What does nationalism do?
1) It encourages people to take pride in others achievements.
	Rather than getting satisfaction by viewing you own achievements nationalism encourages you to get satisfaction in what others
		have done.
	A consequence of this is there is no desire or need to improve yourself.
	All you needed came with what society you grew up in.
2) It encourages people to an 'us versus them' mentality.
	Those in the 'us' group are given (unearned and untested) good will.
	Those in the 'them' group are given suspicion and sometimes hatred.
	Sometimes those in the 'us' group will take advantage of naive people.
	Sometimes those in the 'them' group might become your friend.
	It is stupid to adopt an 'us versus them' mentality based on your society.
	You limit yourself in denying possible influence and opening yourself to being used.
