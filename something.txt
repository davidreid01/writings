Barriers to learning.

Ego:
The ego can be opposed to learning, but doesn't need to be.


Help.

Something that kills desire to help is being insulted for the attempt.
Ex: Asking if its OK for the car to be leaking fuel?
	I was told you don't know much about cars, do you?
	I had to admit I didn't and apologised for wasting time.
	He laughed. I felt dumb.
	The car was not leaking much fuel, he had simply overfilled it and being a hot day
	it had expanded and pushed out.
	If I had of known this, I'd never have interrupted him.
	Not so simple there is more ...
	If I had of known his response but did not know about cars, I'd also not have interrupted him.
	I did not merely not know much about cars, I knew even less about people.
	I had pointed out his error, my ignorance allowed him to avoid facing it and also showing that
	I was wrong. This left me with the notion 'If you try to help then you can be abused'.
Help can only be a win-win situation if both parties respect each other.
You are only helping if the helpee becomes wiser.
To often so called 'help' is not help it is only an attempt at ego victory.
"You are stupid, I'll do it." "

Getting Help:
1) The helper must either desire to help or be tricked into it.

Giving Help:


Hints:
Hints are a way of telling a person something without any commitment to what is said.
"I will give you a hint." translates as "my knowledge is superior to yours".
Hints are often ignored as they seem like fact that the person does not back up but are regarded as an opinion.
