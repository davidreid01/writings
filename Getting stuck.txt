Getting stuck

Do you not know what to do next?
Do you not know where you are going?
Is life rolling by and you are not getting anything you want to do done?
Is your life continually focussed on earning money, paying bills?
Do you think "Why am I doing this shit?".

Think back to your childhood.
You had dreams of the future. Eg. I want to be a fireman.
You fearlessly explored. 
There was much you didn't know but risked to find out.

Then came the dark times.
You found out what was required for any dream to become reality.
Maybe there weren't monsters in the dark but there sometimes were sharks lurking in the water beyond your vision.
There were spiders in some of the holes you poked your finger.

The fearless explorer was gone.
