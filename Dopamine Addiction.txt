Dopamine Addiction

There is a method of reward in the brain called the chemical dopamine.
It is there to make you feel good about getting things done.
This is in interest of the survival of the species.
To push you to develop and execute a successful plan.

The problem:
Dopamine is addictive.
The dopamine system can be tricked.
  Good feeling can be delivered without anything being achieved.

It can be tricked by alcohol, gambling, cell phone use, etc.

My experience has shown alcohol can make a person feel their life is OK when it isn't.

I have wondered why people get addicted to poker machines.
  After all there is no huge prize, the usual maximum is about $10,000.
  The player progressively loses money as the bet is (always) in the favor of the operator.
  From what I speculate the reason is that there is a dopamine hit with the small wins.

What about lotteries?
  The chance of winning top prize is very low often less than 1 in a million.
  But the chance of winning any prize is not that low considering playing numerous games.
  This gives the dopamine hit.

  I have begun projects but have not finished most of them.
  I am addicted to the dopamine hit from video games and alcohol.
  Alcohol is a drug that directly gives a dopamine release which feels good.
  Video games give a release of dopamine when you get further in the game (complete a quest, gain a level).
  Dopamine is a reward for getting things done these give the reward without getting anything of worth done.
  Giving up alcohol is relatively easy if your real addiction is dopamine and there is another way it is supplied.
  Perhaps having a good friend could enable overcoming of the false use of dopamine, I shall never know.
  Yet most people are sarcastic and seem to enjoy others wrecking themselves.
