hints

Are a way of saying something without any commitment to what is said.
A hint can mean:
	1) I think you should try this, I want to see what happens.
	2) I simply are required by etiquette of conversation to say something.
		What I believe can be something else entirely and I don't want to be held accountable for it.
	3) This is my belief of how things are but I cannot prove it and don't want to be questioned about it.

Responses to hints.
	1) I already believe the gist of the hint.
		I will continue to do what I was going to do.
		HINT IGNORED.
	2) I don't believe the hint is either good or accurate.
		The hint does not give me reason to change my mind.
		HINT IGNORED.
	3) I don't have any belief about the subject.
		The hint does not give me any reason to form any opinion or choose to do anything.
		HINT IGNORED.
As you can see it is not impressive at accomplishing anything.
So why do people hint then?
So they can say "I told you so".
There is no statements like:
"I am not sure"
"This is only speculation"
"Please consider"
in a hint, just the unsaid statement "I know, you don't" this has the effect on the listener as "I am better than you"
to which the listener will think something like "Go Away"
