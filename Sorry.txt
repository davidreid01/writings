Sorry the hardest word to say.

Americans often complain about other English speakers as being apologetic to the point of being weak.
But saying "sorry" is not necessarily an admission of culpability.
There is a difference in what people say and what people think.

Sometimes the words "I'm sorry" are said but what goes on in the head is quite different.
Eg.
WORDS - "I'm sorry"
THOUGHT - "I'm sorry that you did that."
THOUGHT - "I'm sorry that you think that way."

WORDS - "My fault"
THOUGHT - "My fault for being near you."

It is odd that Americans do not accept the difference between thought and word in this regard when
obviously they know it having developed the phrases "bull shit" and "Have a nice day".

What is not odd about Americans is that they cannot understand anybody willingly (not forced) to in any way
accepting blame (for anything at all, especially if they caused the problem).

Some seem to think that saying "I am sorry" means they accept blame.
"You have just given me permission to download my superiority on your 'sorry' ass".

The problem with saying "I am sorry" and thinking something else is that others only hear those words and make up how it applies as they see fit.
