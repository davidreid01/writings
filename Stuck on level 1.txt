Stuck on level 1

Reading recently about the four stages of life.
I have recognised I have been stuck on the first stage.
The indicator of getting stuck here is the need for external validation.

What is meant by 'need for external validation'?
That one seeks general approval and does not deal with disapproval.

What is needed?
1) Deal with reality.
2) Remain unchanged by opinion.

A person who has a need for external validation is effected by people expressing negative opinion.

What does this 'need for external validation' cause?
1) The person can easily be manipulated.
The person is controlled by given comments.
Say nice things, you feel good.
Say bad things, you feel bad.
It is not a good thing to feel good about ignoring reality.
It is also not good to ignore reality by focusing on negative comments.

How do others treat such an individual?
1) Contempt that they have not 'grown up'.
2) Prey, the persons gullibility can be used as a source of income.

Note this well:
You can help a person to reform or you can insult them but not both.

How do you help a person reform?
A person must take control of their thinking.
How do you make a person take control of their thinking?
Firstly you can't.
Secondly, swap the word 'make' with the word 'force'.
	You would be taking away their freedom.
So how can you help?
Display the difference between reality and opinion.
Ask them why they base their happiness on peoples opinion.
No guarantees?
No, this is life. It is their choice what they do with their thinking.
I tried and it didn't work.
Are you giving up? It requires persistence.


Where do I fit in?
