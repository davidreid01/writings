RUOK
Are you ok?
Suicide prevention.
What causes people to want to kill themselves?
*) Making a mistake that cannot be recovered from.
*) Having no hope. Believing that life is bad and will not get better.

Problem with this question is it is too easy to think I'm OK and move on 
when what is needed is thoughtful analysis to see if there is a problem and to fix it.
By the time that question is answered 'no', there may be little opportunity to fix the cause.
The other difficulty is that anyone who is thinking of suicide (not just self harming to get attention)
is unlikely to let anyone else know.
What would happen if they did???
old days - incarceration in a mental hospital.
The idea of suicide prevention is to prevent the person from commiting suicide or at least stopping
collateral damage if they do, this means the power even to commit suicide will be taken from them.
Admit you have a problem and there are big negatives and what positives? So why do it?

There was a program promoting awareness of damage caused by suicide.
Unfortunately the person was a young nice looking woman with big boobs.
She may have meant well but might not have communicated a useful message to someone who was depressed.

Do you have real hope?
