Free thinking is needed.

when Ideology becomes tied to society, society puts its controls on ideas.
Different ideas are punished and adhering to or promoting the ideas that are part of the ideology are approved.

There are two aspects:
When the Ideology is right:
Alternative ideas are not right.
This brings the people to believe the ideology is right without question.

When the ideology is wrong:
This opens up the dichotomy between true believers and hypocrites as people who see something as right
hide their ideas and pretend the ideology is right.

Whether the ideology is right or wrong, creativity is suppressed.
Reason is not apparent.
The critic is not enlightened as to why the ideology is correct (if it is).
The criticism is suppressed that would show the ideology wrong (people mistakingly defending society).
The critic is not corrected if the ideology is right.
The criticism does not allow the ideology to reform if the ideology is wrong.

Ideology and society are "out there words" try beliefs and friends to be closer to home.
Imagine someone saying I will not be your friend unless you believe what I tell you.
Desperate people will have friends like this, others will say 'bye' without any niceness.
Putting such a condition on friendship is obscene.
Some communities have such restrictions, example a church.

Be aware of 'like minded groups' they will punish dissent, ultimately with expulsion.
This is not democratic and inevitably people who seek power will take control of such groups.
