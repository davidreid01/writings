Chapter - Planning.

Are you headed for trouble?

Answer these questions.
Yes or no, if you answer "Don't Know" treat as a No.
1) Do you have a plan?
2) Is your plan going to succeed?
3) Is the success of your plan going to provide what you need and want?
4) Are you making progress on your plan?

Answer "no" to any question you are headed for trouble.
Is this it? If I don't answer "no" am I OK?
Not so fast.
If you wrongly answered any question then you are also headed for trouble.
Time for a review.

False Ideas people promote about planning.
1) Plans deny flexibility.
- Plans are thinking about what you are going to do in advance of the situation.
- Plans are what you will do in the absence of anything better.
- Plans are what you will do in without coming up with anything better.
- Plans are what you will do in without thinking of something better.
- Plans can be reformed as new information becomes available.
- Plans don't prevent you from adapting or "winging it".

2) Plans must be detailed, fixed and complete before you do anything
therefore you will do nothing suffering from "analysis paralysis".
- The more detailed and complete plans are the better.
- The only plan that is fixed is the one never to be touched again.
- You don't know everything nor ever will yet you must choose what to do.

3) You don't plan simple things anyway.
Do you have to write down a plan for tying your shoe laces, eating breakfast or breathing?
- Planning does not just mean writing things down - See "What is a plan?".
- Don't be so sure you didn't plan simple things.
	At some time that activity was new and it required you to think through how to do it.
	As you repeated that activity the plan was stored in your brain and though you no longer
		needed conscious thought you still had a plan.
<!-- Assertion need references. -->

4) Plans are of no use.
- See "Advantages of planning".

Why do people promote wrong ideas about planning?
1) They do not have a plan themselves. (STUPID)
- Maybe looking for comfort in being a part of the crowd of people who don't plan.
2) They do not want you to have a plan that might interfere with their plan. (EVIL)
Note: Wrong ideas are promoted by either stupidity or evil. This is a recurrent theme.


What is a plan?
A plan is a goal that is to be achieved and a list of activities that need to be completed before that goal can be accomplished.
Plans are first held in the brain, they should be written down so it is not forgotten and to be a single source that can be shared.
It is similar to the argument structure:
Argument			Plan
Premise 1			Activity 1
Premise 2			Activity 2
...				...
Premise n			Activity n
__________________________________________
Conclusion			Goal

Do you have a plan?
If no make a plan and read on, if so review your plan and read on.

Making a Plan.
Start with the goal.
What do you want to accomplish?
If how to do it is not part of your subconcious already like tying your shoe laces then the activity
of writing it down will focus your mind.
Then ask what needs to be done to achieve this? Again write it down.
Eg.
Goal - buy own home.
Activity - Get a high paying job or business.
That is the plan started, simple but incomplete.
An effective plan needs activities to describe what must be done.

Plans within plans.
Each activity in the plan will need a plan.
The activity is now the goal which need other activities to achieve it.
Does this go on forever?
No, at some point your plan will be already in your brain of how to do it.

Refining the Goal.
The goal is suitably vague at the early stage.
Establish the reason for the goal.
EG. Goal - buy own home.
Ask why?
Reasons might be financial security or social status.
In the example we will presume this is sufficient reason.
You may decide the goal itself is not worth pursuing, if so a new goal will be required.
Do not underestimate having a reason for the goal.
Clarify the goal.
EG. Goal(refined) - get enough money to buy home.
EG. Goal(more refined) - lawfully earn enough money to buy home.
Question the goal further.
EG. Which home to buy? Where? When? How much to spend?
Questions have a priority to answer them and can be put to the side until later.
These questions become activities that must be completed before accomplishment is possible.
EG. New Activity - Decide Which home to buy? Where? When? How much to spend?

Refining Activities.
Each activity is to become a goal which you need other activities to complete.
EG. New goal - Get a high paying job or business.
EG. New goal(refined) - Get a high paying job.
EG. New activity - Get competency in a needed skill.

Keep repeating till activities become something you can do.

Example From the top.
FIRST STEP: Start Plan.

Add activities as you see them.
NEXT STEP: Break activities down into smaller steps (keep doing it).
					activity - Study course curriculum.
				activity - Get good enough grades at high school or college.
				activity - Choose career.
			activity - Be accepted for training by university or apprenticeship.
			activity - Pass all tests and assignments.
		activity - Complete university or apprenticeship.
	activity - Develop social networks, get to know people in the business.

From this you can see that the goal of home ownership becomes a reason high school homework is an important step.
Things change as time goes by and the plan needs to reflect this change.
Continuing example:
I did not get good enough grades to study law at Harvard with scholarship but the local university has
an information technology degree that I am even more interested in than law at Harvard.
NEW PLAN:
		activity - Complete university or apprenticeship.
	activity - Develop social networks, get to know people in the information tech business.
	activity - Get competency in programming, network management.
	activity - Research IT companies that I would like to work for eg. Microsoft, IBM, Apple.
Activity - Become a well respected, well skilled IT professional.
Activity - Decide Which home to buy? Where? close to work. When? I need a comfortable place to live.
Goal - Buy home that is comfortable and close to work.

Somethings people say about plans and what the may mean instead:
1) I don't have a life plan.
- I do have a plan but do not want to tell you.
- I hope you don't have a life plan.
- I believe plans are fixed and I want to be flexible.
- I am working on developing myself and there is a lot I do not know.
 

Lawrence J Peter:- If you don't know where you're going you will probably end up somewhere else.
Ben Franklin/Mark Twain(Ref needed):- Failing to plan is planning to fail.
Some US President(Ref needed):- Plans are useless but planning is essential.

Advantages of planning.
1) Planning answers or at least asks questions that may need answering.
In knowing questions that may come up later allows you to work on answering them before your confronted with them.

Why and when to plan?
Plans are required when:
1) They contain anything that you are likely to forget.
2) They involve more than you.

Is your plan going to succeed?
You are unlikely to know whether your plan will be successful until it is.
However you can often know if a plan is likely to fail and you can guestimate the likelihood of success.

Is the success of your plan going to provide what you need and want?
Not much point succeeding in a plan that will not benefit you.

Are you making progress on your plan?
<!-- not here: This is the execute or do part of your plan, it is where you will put the most time an effort in.-->
So far you should have chosen a plan and listed many things that need to be done.
Quotes from Napoleon Hill about dedication.
Winston Churchill (Ref Needed): It is good to occasionally look at the results of the plan.
There are two parts:
1) Looking back: what you have done.
2) Looking forward: what you will do.

Daily progress:	Let no day pass without applying some effort to the plan.
Looking back:		what did I get done yesterday.
	Questions to ask:
		What did I get done of the plan yesterday?
		Could have I done it better, faster or easier?
		Did I learn anything that means I should add an activity or review the plan?
Looking forward:	what will I do today.
	Assemble a list of items to do today.

Weekly Progress: Let no week pass without making noticeable progress.
Looking back:
	Questions to ask:
		Did you learn anything last week that means the plan should be reviewed?
		What did you get done last week?
		Compare it with the previous weeks looking forward.
		If you got more expected done than you thought last week, be thankful, maybe the activities
			you assigned to get done were easier than you thought. There may be some down time available.
		If you got less expected done than you thought last week, persist, maybe the activities
			you assigned to get done were harder than you thought. This lack of progress may
			need to be made up elsewhere.
Looking forward:
	Review the plan if necessary.
	List what you wish to get done this week.
