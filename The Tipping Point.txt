The Tipping Point

In going from the marginal usage to major popular usage of a process or tool there comes a time referred to as the tipping point.
There is also beliefs that go from marginal to major popularity, they also have what is referred to as a tipping point.

Where is the tipping point?
The tipping point is between the creation of the idea and its mainstream acceptance.
Obvious, can we narrow it down?

A new idea firstly has only its inventor as its support.
As others see the new idea they can choose to use it or not.
Most ideas stop here.
If an idea does not appeal to others they will not use it.
It will not appeal if:
	it does nothing to increase the capability of the person.
If the idea appeals to people it will spread to others.
Those who seek to increase their capability (all entrepreneurs) are on the look out for good ideas.
Those who want power over others are on the lookout for any ideas that could diminish their power.
	Holding power over others is done by controlling the ideas that can influence the ruled.
At this point few people have the idea but those interested in power are watching out.
Ideas that seem useful will be picked up and used by entrepreneurs.
Ideas that threaten the status quo of power will attract hate from those who stand to lose power.

Speculation:
The tipping point is reached when the average person decides that the proposed path is a better bet.
Then many people will choose it, so it will look like a landslide.
People are motivated by many things, some are: wealth, hunger, social rank and the long term satisfaction of those things.

An idea can be better but if adopting it has social penalties, these will also be weighed up.
The cost of the social effect is more important to people than the idea itself.
If an idea saved you lots eg. you completed your work twice as efficiently. but it cost you your position in society or respect
from your peers most would shun the idea, it would be a thing not worth it.
