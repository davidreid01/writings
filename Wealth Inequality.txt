Wealth Inequality

Have you heard statistics like the top 2% own most of the worlds wealth.

Inequality is not the problem.
Why?
Male is not equal to female.
Competant is not equal to incompetant.
Jupiter is not equal to Mars.
Cat is not equal to dog.
Pursuing equality is not going to make the situation better.
Sure it will make it better for some, at the expense of others.
Minimum wage laws do not prevent workers from being swindled and underpaid but deny incentive for employers
to hire the unemployed.
Unfair dismissal laws do not prevent people from being fired unfairly (they certainly do not help anyone when firing fairly).
Yet there is a cost for this and it comes from employers being reluctant to hire.


What is the problem?
People are not living wisely.
Wisely? What do you mean by that?
What should be sought is the better future of the human race.
The human race is the only thing that really matters.



Inability or simply lacking motivation to think properly is the problem.
If you lack proper health you will not be able to make good decisions.
If you are motivated to make bad decisions you will.
If you are not motivated to make good decisions you will take the easy option which someone else has prepared for you and is usually bad.
If you have financial incentive to make poor decisions you likely will.
If you are denied what is needed to make a decision and it is urgent that you do decide you will pick up
whatever decision is close at hand, that is often not the best.
Bad people take advantage of the gullible and there is incentive to encourage people to be gullible, more dupes, more profit.
