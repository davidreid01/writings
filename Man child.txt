Man Child


Ever known of that guy who has not grown up?

There are two sorts of Man Child:
1) The extreme or pure Man Child.
	This is the worst.
	The boy has not become independant of 'mother'.
2) Substitutive Man Child.
	Not as bad but still not good.
	The 'mother' is taken over by the wife.

Some indicators of being a Man Child:
1) Still dependant on mother/wife for unnecessary things.
	Examples:
	a) ironing clothes.
2) Still lives with parents unless forced to by economics.
	It must be forced, if you are there simply because of economic expediency then you may not have grown up.
3) Has not ever lived independently (at least 3 months) of parents and without wife.
4) Do not know how to behave to women.

Some bad things about being a Man Child:
These are not independant of each other.
1) Disrespect.
	A Man Child is not respected by anyone.
2) Low Status.
	A Man Child is considered a failure as a man.
3) Shunned by women.
	A Man Child fails to show any of the admirable traits of the alpha male but also indicates he is owned by another women even if that woman is his mother.

How might you recognize symptoms of being or becoming a Man Child?
Do you have any of the indicators above?
Are you dominated by anyone?
Do you feel capable of doing something different without feeling the need to ask approval of anyone?
Are you dependant on anyone?
	This question may need further explanation.
	It does not refer to needing someone with specialist skill eg. a plumber.
	It does refer to needing someone specific eg. this and only this plumber, this is a dependancy that you don't want.
