Great Sight

Robert Burns Scottish poet
"
O wad some pow'r the Giftie gie us
to see our sels as others see us.
"
Perception is a brain function not an eye function.

We use the image of sight to mean either eye function or understanding.
The context is meant to remove ambiguity but often does not.

Why can we see something about others but we cannot see similar things about ourselves?

Problem of interpretation.
When we look in the mirror we 'see' not just our image reflected but an interpretation of ourselves
which is different from other peoples interpretation of us.
