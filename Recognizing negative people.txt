Recognizing Negative people.

People who are good for you push you to be a better person, people who are bad for you don't.
Note: This is 'good for you' not just 'good'.
  1) You need to distinguish whether they are promoting you to be better or not rather than engaging in an act of moral judgement.
    They may be good for others but not you.
  2) Most people are indifferent and say what is good or bad depending on what benefits them, their emotional state and their overall
    opinion of you.
  3) People do make mistakes. Often they act on their feelings and opinions.
    Don't write a person off as a negative based on one incident.
    To help them, remember it. Each time they are negative means they are deeper in the hole.
    Some are in so deep that you will not be able to help them.
When you speak to someone if you come away often thinking 'yeah, I can do this better' they are being good for you.
If you walk away feeling guilty, demeaned or humiliated and they have not given you an avenue of improvement, they expect you to figure things out,
then this person is being negative to you.
If a person ever holds you in contempt they are being negative to you.
