Failing to see.

Ever noticed how some people (most of the people, most of the time) are focussed on getting something done and ignore much of what is going on?
There is a short video of people playing basketball and a person in a gorilla suit walks by in the background.
Most people do not notice the person in the gorilla suit till it is pointed out and they rewatch the video.
This is normal.
The memory of the situation is often not discarded but no processing about what is thought irrelevant is done.
The processing of the memory can be done later when it becomes relevant.
