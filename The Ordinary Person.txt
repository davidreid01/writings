The Ordinary Person

Most people most of the time think about themselves.
To not think about yourself most of the time is abnormal.
Where good people differ from selfish people is how they think about the species/whole race.
A good person will sacrifice themselves for another person or to improve the race a selfish person will not.
It needs to be said that selfish people will want to be seen as good people without the cost of being good.
It stands to reason that what a person says about themselves is useless.
As peoples personalities and ideas change it also stands to reason that what a person thinks of themselves
is not a useful indicator of what they will do.
