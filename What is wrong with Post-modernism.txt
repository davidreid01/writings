What is wrong with Post-modernism?

(study what Post-modernism is)

Binary thinking.
Explaining things in terms of binary opposites leads practitioners of Post-modernism to think themselves superior to others.
By claiming society expresses things in terms of opposites therefore society is most likely a black and white thinker or at least one
dimensional if they include a grey scale.
They would think of themselves thinking in many dimensions even if they only speak in one.

I suspect that Jacques Derrida and all post modernist thinkers do not think in binaries but the binaries are used to manipulate the masses
