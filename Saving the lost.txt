Saving the lost

Attempts to restore me and why they did not succeed.

1)
Fine restaurants, shopping centres and the starry sky.

The Starry Sky.
See what God has done.
Yet what has he revealed to me?
Sure it may say how great God is but is there any hint of my purpose in this?

Fine restaurants, shopping centres and other marvels of man.
See the city at night.
Man has achieved great things.
They achievements belong to others not me.
Do they hint at what I can do?
Hardly,
These achievements do not point out what I can do.
