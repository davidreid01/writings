Learning to fly

Want to fly?
Here is how you can know if you can.
Stand in a clear space (no low ceiling fans) and jump.
You only need to jump an inch above the ground.
If you fall back to earth you failed to fly.

If you try to justify your failure, what makes you think that you failed to fly because you didn't have time to develop the faith?
Answer and be precise.
Your success at being able to fly will not increase because you are falling at a greater distance or you believe more sincerely that you can.
Do I need to 'prove' this statement?
'Sincerity' or 'faith' are obscure concepts and may be impossible to scientifically test.
If you don't have the faith at one inch what makes you think you will have the faith at a greater height (where you will smash yourself if you can't)?
Can I do it regularly and with confidence that I will not fail?
If you can't do it regularly and confidently when the stakes are low (a simple jump) what will give you the confidence
that you will be able to do it if the stakes are high (falling off a cliff or a building)?



An olympic jumper is someone who fails to fly better than others.
