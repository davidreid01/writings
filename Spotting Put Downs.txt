Spotting Put Downs

Do you feel bad when speaking to some people, but not sure why?
Some people hold you in contempt and will sarcastically deride you.
Some people are testing to see whether you can identify sarcasm and will hold you in contempt if you can't.
This is related to but not the same as testing by falsehood.

Some put downs will be obvious to everyone others will be subtle.
There is one thing that distinguishes a put down:
  *) Put Downs focus on making you look stupid.
    There is no focus on what is the truth.
    There is no attempt to correct bad logic or bad speech.
The logic behind a put down is you say dumb things because you are dumb.
