It is not a crime unless you get caught.

This idea was introduced by the Spartans.
It was OK to steal if you didn't get caught.
	If you did get caught you deserved punishment.
	If the victim could not or would not identify the perpetrator then the victim lacked something important and so deserved the loss.

The Winner takes all.
	The strong do what they want the weak suffer what they must.

Why did Athens survive and Sparta fall.
The fall of Sparta.
Two towns of Ancient Greece, Athens and Sparta are curious in many ways.
They are similar in many ways:
	They both currently exist.
	They are both populated by modern Greeks who are closer to the ancient Athenians than the ancient Spartans.
Why were they different:
	Sparta had a disciplined, military, tough culture.
	Athens had a profit seeking democracy.

Though neither the ancient Athenians or ancient Spartans knew it, Sparta had killed off its feedback analysis where Athens had developed it.
When times changed Athens survived Sparta did not.
