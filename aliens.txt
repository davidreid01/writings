aliens

Don't mind me, just let me park my UFO.

Non Americans are referred to as aliens in America.
This is odd for Australians, maybe odd for other non Americans.
Maybe an alien but not an extra-terrestrial.
Do Canadians get given this description?
Am I only an alien when I'm in America? Losing my alien status when I go home.
Always to Americans I am a foreigner whether in America or not.

Look up US definition of alien.
