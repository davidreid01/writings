How I went wrong

1) Trusting things I did not have evidence for.

2) Pretending things were OK when they were not.

3) Ignoring evidence that supported things I did not want to believe.

Hints I ignored:
1) People I was trusting were indifferent to me.
2) People I was trusting were only interested in what they could get out of me.
3) People 'helping' me would simply do the job not show me how to do the job myself.
