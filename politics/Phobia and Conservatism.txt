Homophobia, Transphobia, Islamaphobia and Conservatism

What these words share in common is phobia to the conservative mind this means fear which comes from the Greek 'Phobos'.
To leftists these are insults and ways of describing belief and bad behaviour.

Conservative thinking will regard them as nonsensical "I don't fear faggots, I hate them."
"In survival of our culture I don't fear the muslim, I will fight them. Fear is weakness, to lie down and be killed."

Leftists use these words to put others down and relatively raise themselves. "You are evil, I am not."
The big point is using these words convinces no one of anything.
These accusations elicit, bring forth a defensive reaction.
To the recipient of such insults their position in society is being disputed, they are being accused of an offense.

The leftist approach may be correct in that discrimination is based on fear but that is unhelpful as most will not understand this.
Most will only understand that they have been accused and need to mount a defense.
Calling a persons discrimination to be based on fear is virtue signalling (in that I am better than them).
