Left vs Right, Good vs Evil

Most of politics is described left vs right but many people don't think that way.
There is a way of looking at how many people support candidates, parties or even ideas and that is 'moreforme'.
MoreForMe explains individual behaviour more accurately than does a left-right analysis.

Conservatism - preserve what is.
Radicalism - change what is.

People want to preserve what they think is good and change what they think is bad or evil.
We are yet to define what good and evil are.
We are yet to define what each person thinks are good or bad.
Good/Evil is a completely different dimension to left/right.
To reduce a person or an idea to left/right is to ignore the other dimensions.
Politicians do this to separate the people into Us and Them camps so that they will vote against much of what they believe.
You can be for self improvement and struggling thru adversity conservative virtues but against corporate socialism, bank bailouts, tax cuts for the rich.
Do you define yourself as a conservative?
  Maybe you do, but the question put to you is which team are you on?
Your thinking on any particular issue is irrelevant.
