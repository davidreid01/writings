A Rewarding life as seen by others

Young Adult:
  Competency, they will have no/few personal achievements.
  What they can have is skill and potential to develop the skill.

Elderly:
  Achievements.
  Competency is now irrelevant as potential is gone and skill diminishes.

Middle Age:
  Competency and achievements.
  By now a person needs to be extremely competant in their area of expertise.
  If you have a useful skill to a very high level then achievements will come quickly.
  If you do not have a skill to a very high level then achievements will be rare if at all.
