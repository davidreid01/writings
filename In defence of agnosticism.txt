In defence of Agnosticism

1) Truth/Reality/Is

2) Knowledge

3) Belief

Atheism is a question of BELIEF.
Agnosticism focusses on KNOWLEDGE.

Strong Atheism - I believe God does not exist.
Weak Atheism - I do not believe in God because I have seen no evidence for such a belief.

One way of describing of agnosticism - 
Strong Agnosticism - God's existence is unknowable.
Weak Agnosticism - I don't have any evidence of God's existence or lack of it.
Another way - 
Strong agnosticism - I have explored the issues personally. What evidence have I overlooked?
Weak agnosticism - I haven't explored the issues personally. I just want you to stop trying to persuade me.

Some regard the agnosticism which says "Go away." as lame.
Maybe it is but the agnostic will always rate KNOWLEDGE as more important than BELIEF.

Some will think strong is better than weak.
This is only following the anthropic principle language.
Perhaps a better way would be stubborn for strong and flexible for weak.

Dealing with someone who wants to lead you into religion.
Continue to ask "How do you know?".
I have never heard a decent answer.

Dealing with someone who wants to lead you into anti-religion.
Is what I believe more important than what I know?
So what do you do with a fundamentalist who says you are going to hell?
Repeat the question "How do you know?".
