deserve

Deserve?
What do you deserve?
Christianity:
	All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
	There is no one righteous ... all have turned away and become worthless. St Paul in letter to Romans quoting Psalm??
	Man is appointed to die once and then face judgement. Hebrews ?

	In short - you deserve death.

Materialism:
	Deserve has no substance, it is a constructed imagination to explain things.
	In short - 'deserve' does not exist.

Charity to the deserving.
	If deserve does not exist or everyone deserves death then how can 'deserve' be a condition of giving?
	Jimmy Carr: "When it comes to charity some people stop at nothing."
