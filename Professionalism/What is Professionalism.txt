What is 'Professionalism'?

Professionalism is returning value for the purchaser in exchange for money.

This is different to theft which is delivering no value in exchange for money.
Fraud is delivering either false value, non existant value.
	There is also delivering value that is less than what the purchaser believes which may or may not be fraud.
