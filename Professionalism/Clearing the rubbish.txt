Clearing the rubbish.

As said before the aim of 'professionalism' is to be able to deliver service for pay.
Anything that gets in the way of that is a problem.
The focus here is to eliminate the things that prevent you ever from being professional.
1. Take care of yourself.
This may seem obvious but it is often ignored.
You need to be in a physically capable state to be professional.
Not getting enough sleep, not eating right, not doing adequate exercise, abusing drugs are some things that
can keep your performance down.
The reason you should take care of yourself is no one else will and you'll suffer for not doing it.
