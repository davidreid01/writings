Follow the money

Ask the question 'how can I determine whether someone is a fraud?'

Look at how they live their life.
Look at where their treasure is.
	Even Jesus said 'where a man's treasure is there his heart is also.' (Ref)

Where the leader is making money and the followers are not, money is flowing from the followers to the leaders.
This is different from worthwhile activity where there is an excess of profit.
This is different from proper leadership where profits are shared.
This is different from proper leadership where the leader gets their share after the followers, leader eats last.

Fraudsters want money and are not hindered by morality when it comes to telling lies to do so.
Getting their hands on money is the objective, if people choose to believe false things then they are suckers.

If the activity is worthwhile it will be generating profit.
If an enterprise is not generating profit the causes are either
1) It is being mismanaged.
OR
2) It is not a worthwhile activity to begin with.

Ask are the followers becoming richer?
	and include the new followers.
	Pyramid schemes reward older followers with the contributions of the younger followers.


What if an enterprise is not gaining profit?
The entrepreneur goes without.
The leader goes without.
The management does not get bonuses.
The people at the top question what their organisation is doing.
They ask why? and what is wrong?
How do religious leaders respond to a down turn?
Blame God? - No.
	This would call into question the entire basis of the enterprise.
Blame themselves? - No.
	This would call into question their position.
