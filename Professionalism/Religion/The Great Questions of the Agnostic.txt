The Great Questions of the Agnostic

First great question:
How do you know?

Second great question:
How can I know?

This is in same style as Jesus's Great Commandments.

Great questions and the existance of God.
1) How do you know?
The answer to this comes in two main forms.
i)	Revelation.
ii)	Faith.
Let us deal with them one at a time.
i) Revelation - God has shown you his truth.
How, exactly?
a) Direct revelation.
Hearing voices?
b) Indirect revelation.
Believing God is the way the bible says because the bible 'feels' true.
God is true because the existance of your 'conscience' is and your knowledge of good and evil.

ii)	Faith - I believe because I believe because I believe ...
It is easy to see this is not an answer at all rather a way of filling an awkward silence caused by being asked a question
they do not know the answer to and refusal to admit they don't know the answer.
