the good of christianity

Christianity is a fusion of Hebrew religion and Greek philosophy.
Jesus may have rejected Greek philosophy and culture (the wedding at Cana, early in Jesus ministry being the exception).
St Paul certainly didn't both arguing that:
	1) Gentiles be converted.
	2) Gentiles need not abide by Jewish customs, circumcision was a big one.
	3) A move to explaining why things are as they are, rather than relying on authority to compel belief.
		This was the central point of Greek thought.
		That everyone can and should think for themselves.

What is good about Christianity?
In combining Hebrew religion and Greek philosophy several ideas then developed.
	1) Theology - that one could apply one's reason to the subject, from Greek Theos - God Logos - word/reason.
The medieval question "How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?" may seem to us today as silly but to even to think up this question
needs both religion (for the angels) and philosophy (in bringing the idea of extension or length which can be measured) to them.
Theology then was acquired by the Jews and the Muslims.

	2) Science - Once theology was developed, the Greek use of reason was applied to other areas.
It is important to note that science was developed in Christian Western Europe and there alone, nowhere else did it develop.
Why not elsewhere?
Classical Greece developed philosophy why not science?
	Polytheism - the experiment you do on Monday can be undone on Tuesday, the gods are capricious that way.
Ancient Hebrews - they lacked philosophy.
Medieval Islam

There were considered two great books for learning:
		a) scriptures - the bible, the word of God.
		b) nature - the world God created
