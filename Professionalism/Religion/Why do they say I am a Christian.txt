Why do some people say I am a Christian?

"First you gotta know I am a Christian"

To the non religious this sounds like "I believe things I am told without evidence"
or even worse "I have had a brain injury and anything I may say is daft".
To those of a different religion this is an admission you have accepted the lies of the enemy.
This statement raises questions rather than setting context.
Questions such as:
"You say you are a christian but are you really?"
"What sort of christian?"
	Protestant, catholic, orthodox, bible believing (literal or allegorical), born again or something else?
	The list is huge and includes what your particular stance on a particular doctrine.

Let us look at the result of doing this.
1) Non christians will hold you in contempt.
2) Christians will have questions raised about your faith.
The mind of the listener is now sent in a direction that has nothing to do with what is said next.
Good communicators (including all fraudsters) don't do this.

Why do they do this?
Ignorance.
	They do not realise that it will put non christians off.
	They do not realise that it raises questions in christians minds that are unrelated to what will be spoken about.
But don't they hope that it means they side with christians?
	They may hope, but it doesn't really confer the fraternity they think it does.
