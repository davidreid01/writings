The Good, the Bad and the Selfish.

Let us start with some definitions.
Opportunities:
	Something that could be done that will have its own consequences.
	No one will do something they believe will have bad consequences for both themselves and others.
	What about suicide?
	Better definition:
	Something that could be done that will have beneficial consequences for themselves and/or others.

Good:
	the sum of benefits is what is important.
	individual benefit is important but the individual is nothing without the group.
	the self may suffer loss as long as the net effect on the group is positive.
	I care for the environment because others will need it.
	I will say no to opportunities that harm others even though it means I may go without.
Bad:
	only I am important, others do not matter.
	I'd rather be the CEO of a dying company than a factory worker of a successful one.
	I will say 'no' to opportunities only if I think I will be shown to be bad.

Selfish:
	I am the most important yet I depend on others.
	

All people want to be seen as Good.
To be obviously other than Good will attract derision.
There are penalties for being Good.

The Good will:
	- say 'no' to 'opportunity' because it harms someone else.
	- the motive being the net benefit justifies an action, no net benefit, no justification.
The Bad will:
	- say 'yes' to any opportunity that furthers themselves.
	- the motive being action is justified if it benefits me.
	- It is important to high light that getting caught doing evil will have bad consequences.
The Selfish will:
	- evaluate more closely the cost-benefits of any opportunity.
	- consider that they themselves are a witness of any actions.
		they will not accept an opportunity if they think that doing so will cause them mental turmoil,
			inner grief or qualms of conscience.
