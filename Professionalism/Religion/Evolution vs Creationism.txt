Evolution vs Creationism

This is no longer a topic for debate in most advanced countries - there is a lot of evidence for evolution,
there is none (nor can there be) for creationism.

So what's the problem?
World view, religion has dominated peoples world view for a long time (into antiquity).
Many have made careers of this, some have become very rich while most become poorer some even giving their life.
But is it true?
People have started to choose their world view and look for themselves by asking questions like how do I know this?
rather than accept what someone in a position of power has told them.
Science is needed to answer questions without regard to who the questioner or answerer are.
As people more and more reject the notion of having their world view chosen for them by an authority
