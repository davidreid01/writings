promotion in religion

Promotion in a religious organization has nothing to do with either intelligence or sincerity of belief.
It certainly has nothing to do with the truth.
Speaking well is good but this alone is not the criteria.
It is only based on gaining followers.
Whatever you are or do if you do not gain followers you are not important.
This would make it 'pyramid selling' or a 'Ponzi' scheme.
Without God it is this.
The absence of evidence of God means it is this.
There are people who genuinely believe but most of them are at the bottom of the pyramid and cannot see the scam.
There are people who regard it as a scam and join the religion with this in mind.
These people see the line of promotion and although they may start down the bottom, they will push for promotion.

What evidence is there for the idea that it is a scam?
Two pieces are required:
1) The people who are high in the organization are corrupt.
2) God does not point out the corruption.
The second part is necessary to dismiss the notion that genuine belief makes it true and the corruption can simply be blamed on some bad people.
