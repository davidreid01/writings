Why do christians not act christ like?

Christianity is a religion.
In that:
	*) it is something that people believe
	*) it contains beliefs that are undemonstrable

The first part of any religion is PRETEND.
I pretend that God communicates to me.
I pretend that God is my friend.

ASIDE - Can we eliminate the idea of religion from this analysis, it does seem to apply to astrology which people do not think of as a religion?

What is not pretend is the need to be a part of a group.
This need is hard wired into our biology by evolution, this came long before any notion of religion or God.
If the requirement put to the person by the group (or the groups controller) is to believe a certain idea then
there is a motivation to believe that idea.
You either profess to believe the idea or you are not part of the group.
Evidence might be nice but it is not required.
Why search for evidence if the evidence may point that the belief is wrong?
If it is shown to be wrong then submitting to it is an act of denial that you would be aware of.
