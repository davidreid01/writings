Morality with and without religion

It is commonly said that the foundation of morality is religion, is this true?
Some peoples morality is based on religious ideas.
One criticism of religion has that people are only good because God is watching
and will reward them with heaven and punish them with hell.

My perception: Religion does not improve a persons morality.
If it did religious people I know would have been real bad before they came to religion.
