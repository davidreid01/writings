Reformation

The Protestant Reformation
This is what the Church says.
This is what the Bible says.
They are different.
Keep what God says, discard what man says.

The General Reformation
This is what Man says or writes.
This is what reality leads to.
If Man differs from reality then Man is wrong.

But what of interpretation?
In the Protestant reformation it was hoped that the bible written in the local language and God's personal guidance
would lead people to come up with the same answers, it didn't.
Protestant Christianity split into many denominations based on different interpretations.
In the General Reformation Man's interpretation may be wrong, reality remains.
