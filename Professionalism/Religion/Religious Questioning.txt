Religious Questioning

Ask people who make some sort of claim 'How do you know?'.

Particular to christian evangelists they will answer the question (when they don't know) in one of two ways:
1) I believe because I believe because I believe ...
This is the same as 'faith' answers.
This gets you nowhere.
It is a non-answer.
2) This person told me.
This is silly, how do they know the person wasn't deceiving them or that the person was deluded.
Who believes something just because someone said so.
So what if they wrote it down.
The bible is written down but it is still some peoples ideas and opinions.
Is this anymore trustworthy?
There are other examples of writings that people trust but are not trustworthy.
Examples.
Adolph Hitler's Mein Kampf.
Chairman Mao's Little Red Book.

Why ask them at all?
1) The evangelist may have not but now realize that they do not know.
2) Other listeners will be encouraged to ask questions.
