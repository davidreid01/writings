Middle Class Christianity

Why is it lame?
It professes the bible to be the inspired word of God but it acts according to normal worldly pursuits.
Jesus says 'do not worry', James says 'plans can only succeed if God wills them' (need accurate ref)
these verses however do not enter their thinking when it comes to succeeding in life, planning a career,
saving money.
How do they get around this?
Re-interpreting those verses to mean something different that makes them not incompatible.
"Do Not Worry".
God knows when a bird falls.
God knows when a plane falls.
God knows when a plane falls because of shody maintenance.
God knows when a plane falls because of shody maintenance and people get killed.
Do they really believe that the mechanic need not worry about the quality of their work?
No.
The re-interpretation:
"Worry" is to be defined differently.
"Worry" does not mean to be concerned with your efforts.
It is only about things that are outside of your control.
Really? Where does this meaning come from?
Your own ideas.
Keep thinking of where this is leading.
You interpret the bible as you want to.
I interpret the bible in light of other parts of the bible.
You did not invoke any other part of the bible to invoke this interpretation.

This is a static argument and opponents will simply say that it does not apply in their case.
