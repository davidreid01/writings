Thinking Denied!

If you think many others want to prevent you from making decisions based on proper evidence then you are right.
If your decisions are based on information they give you then they will gain some level of control over you.

SPECULATION:
All false information you receive has to be processed and rejected by your brain.
This requires effort and is done subconsciously and the effort used in this cannot be applied to real problems.

Advertising and propaganda contain a lot of false information that is processed and rejected.
