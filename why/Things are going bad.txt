Things are going bad

I have hopes to do things.
I start things.
I put in the effort in the early stages.
But it requires persistent sustained effort and without good friends I have no one to disappoint by quitting.
The idea of you are not worthy and you wont get there comes in big and strong to my mind.
Why bother? You wont get there and now it is too late.
I am not making the required achievements, I am not putting in the required effort.
