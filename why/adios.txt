Adios

Cinderella and Empty Hands would rather have superiority over another than for the team to win.
Without God the idea of deserve is useless.
Religion means they cannot think clearly.
Somehow they think if they do their bit then that God will make it all right.
How strange that people of 'the Logos' or in English 'the Word' as in Christian refuse to articulate.
If they see a problem, they may pray but say nothing to those who they have the issue.

God is not coming.
I cannot live anymore with the hate and contempt.

Many moments lost in time
Like tears in rain
Time to die.
Roy Batty 'Blade Runner' played by Rutger Hauer.
