Adios

Cinderella and Empty Hands would rather have superiority over another than for the team to win.
They would rather be victorious over the other than push the team forward.
They have never admitted they have anything wrong that makes a difference at all.
They delight in keeping others dumb and sub-servient.

Without God the idea of deserve is useless.
Religion means they cannot think clearly.
Somehow they think if they do their bit then that God will make it all right.
How strange that people of 'the Logos' or in English 'the Word' as in Christian refuse to articulate.
If they see a problem, they may pray but say nothing to those who they have the issue.
Why do they think that they can solve problems by prayer?
Furthermore, if something annoys them they hit it.
This seems to delight them and they have no intention of fixing problems, just continuing to hit others.
This hitting is metaphorical not literal.
Why would Christians behave like this?
It is clear that their actions are not in line with their beliefs.

God is not coming.
I cannot live anymore with the hate and contempt.

Many moments lost in time
Like tears in rain
Time to die.
