My Suicide

At first I thought that suicide was a cowards way out.
Of not dealing with problems.
Of not being willing to embrace the suffering of life.
I no longer think this.
Suffering is an inevitable part of life and not taught.
Suffering can be useful or useless.
The no pain no gain attitude is where suffering is useful.
You can also suffer for no good reason.
Many have diseases and inflictions thru no fault of their own or even thru the fault of others.

Another reason to not suicide is:
It harms those who like you and gives mirth to those who don't.
This is no longer a valid reason for me as I don't believe that anyone likes me.
