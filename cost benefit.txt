cost benefit

Poorer people think of the big prize and ignore the low probability.
The opposite of this is to think of high probability and ignore the prize.
Richer people do not think this way.
A better way (what the richer people do) is to think of the total reward vs the total cost.
To calculate the total reward,
	Total Reward = Reward * Probability of Reward
	Use calculus, area under graph for more than one prize.
To calculate cost repeat,
	Total cost = Cost * Probability of Cost
If Total Reward > Total Cost then Bet
else do not Bet
Most betting involves the Probabilty of Cost being 100 per cent.

Uncertainty of probability
The Reward is usually made clear, it is advertised or people dream of it but the probability is hidden.
In a bad bet enough is hidden to prevent an easy or direct calculation of probability.
What to do if you cannot calculate Total Reward?
If it is not in your area of competence then say 'no', do not bet.
Many people find it difficult to say 'no', this is a problem and these people will be punished for it.

Other arguments to say 'no' to a bet when Total Reward and Total Cost are undeterminable.
1) The goal of business is to make money.
2) If it is in the client or customers favour to make a bet the business will lose money.
3) This business has lasted and has investors.
Therefore:
C) It is not favourable to make a bet.

There is another factor that most of the successful, many of the rich and those who believe luck is against them consider while
others do not and that is 'Margin of Safety'.
