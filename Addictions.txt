Addictions

What is an addiction?
Anything that prevents you from getting stuff done.

If you have a goal to be achieved an addiction is anything that uses time, wealth, health, resources, etc.
that does not move you toward the achievement or puts the achievement further out of reach.

What addictions offer?
Temporary pleasure or permanent illusion.


Some addictions:
Tobacco
	Costs:
		Health. This is the major cost.
		Wealth. This is a lesser cost but still significant.
			You are either buying it legally and paying a large tax or illegally and still paying high prices
			(though lower than legally) with the side cost of risking being caught for committing an offense.
	Benefits:
		Increase in social standing.
			This is an illusion.
		Feeling good.
			This happens only after physical dependence and is more related to making pain go away.
	Hooks:
		Physical dependency on the chemical.

Alcohol
	Costs:
		Time. This is the big cost of drinking small amounts over a long time.
			Under the influence of alcohol
				*) a bad life can seem good
				*) problems are not dealt with
				*) clear thinking is not possible.
		Risky behaviour - you can do some dangerous things that can get you hurt or killed.
	Benefits:
		A bad life can seem good.
			This is not really a benefit as people need to deal with reality.
		Feeling good.
			It will wear off and then you won't feel good.

Games (Computer)
	Costs:
		Time. This is the major expense.
		Money. This is a minor expense and in some cases can be negligible.
	Benefits:
		Achievement.
			This is an illusion. You only achieve setting bits which either have no meaning (your own computer) or that
			someone else controls (someone else's computer in on line games).

Gambling
	Costs:
		Money.
		Time. 
	Benefits:

In all addictions there is the cost of not achieving your major definate purpose.
You can either spend yourself towards your major definate purpose or spend yourself in addiction but not both.
