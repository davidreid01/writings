Criticism

Image:
The drill sargeant with the squad of soldiers.
The sargeant yells at the soldiers.
The soldiers are required to stand at attention and say or do nothing back regardless of how he riles them.

Why?
The soldiers have to learn to accept feedback even from bad sources.

Criticism. Why positive or negative does not matter.
