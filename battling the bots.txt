battling the bots

(This needs more thought and tidy up)
There is a never ending conflict to capture people's attention.
Advertisers and propagandists seek to promote their ideas.
Your message firmly in place in someone's mind is not easy to dislodge.
If your message is brought to mind then that becomes the basis for decision.
It is important to have your message ready in a person's mind and to exclude any different message.
(Maybe more from the perspective of the person who is saturated in advertising)

People can only think of one thing at a time.

Here come the Bots.
