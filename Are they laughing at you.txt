Are they laughing at you?

People put on a friendly face to others who they consider beneath them.
Saying nice things but secretly gloating that they are in the superior position.
How do we recognize insincere people?

First let us think about how we would treat:
1) Someone we don't trust.
	We would not let them near anything we hold of value.
	We would distract them with things we don't value.
2) Someone we know we are competing with.
	We would not tell them when they are making a mistake.
		This mistake may wreck their chances, we can take the medal while they fall.
	We would let them distract themselves from anything near our own goal.
3) Someone we don't like.
	We would not help them unless we saw that there was more benefit flowing to us than the cost.
