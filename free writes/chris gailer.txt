Recently (Baptism of Andrew's children) Chris asked me to think about what he said.
What did he say?
I asked him how he knew what he knew?
I gave him some outs like personal revelation.
I never pushed him for an answer to this.
Consequently, he never gave an answer.
If he said God gave him a personal revelation then I could have questioned him more on this.
The conversation avoided challenging points and eventually ended with nothing resolved.

This points to what is what is difficult about spoken inter-reactions rather than the written word.
1) Conversations take place in time and sequence.
There is no chance of unsaying things, editing before publication.
This does not apply to writing.
Writing can (and should) be reviewed before publication.
Furthermore if something is not understood it can be re-read.
2) A persons ego, reputation, self esteem, social standing is on display and judged.
This may be similar to writing but the ability to edit is important.
Without the ability to edit a person may be silent and not reveal things even if they are questions or speculations.
3) The conversation has an ordered flow.
Masters of conversation can control the flow and someone else may feel their point has no place in the conversation.
