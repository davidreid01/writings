The problem with life.

You work out what you want to do with your life after the opportunity to reach it has left.
There are two great and terrible discoveries to be made 1) what you want to achieve and 2) you
can no longer achieve it.
How can we solve this riddle?
Certainly not to 100% and perhaps not to anyone's satisfaction.
There are two ways to bridge this gap.
1) Lower goals.
	Want to achieve less, so it can be achieved.
	This might not be popular but reality needs to be faced.
	Some possible achievements will not be possible for you.
	For example: If you are born in 1930 and want to live on the Mars colony. Not going to happen.

2) Gain knowledge early.
	If you want to achieve something then there will be requirements to meet that achievement.
	Start now and when you discover what you want to do, you will have already met some requirements and it may be achievable.
	Problem with this is that though it can help and make things more achievable it is not 100% and you can never learn enough
	to achieve major success far outside your specific area of study.
