By the sea.

15 09 2016

I sit at a table on South Cronulla.
Between looking at the ocean and writing, I am contemplating life.
I have just wrote some notes on the difference between atheism and agnosticism.
To me atheism seemed obnoxious simply telling others they are wrong.
Since I don't believe in God at this instant, I am an athiest at this instant.
So what?
Isn't it better to seek what is true?
Isn't knowledge of the truth a better basis for one's life?

The sea gulls are wandering about, they may find some food but not from me.
No one cares about anything except their own profit.
And this care has little foresight.
